## Row.previous_row property

Gets the previous [Row](../) node.



```python
@property
def previous_row(self) -> aspose.words.tables.Row:
    ...

```

### Remarks

The method can be used when you need to have typed access to table rows. If a
[StructuredDocumentTag](../../../aspose.words.markup/structureddocumenttag/) node is found in a table instead of a row,
it is automatically traversed to get a row contained within.
