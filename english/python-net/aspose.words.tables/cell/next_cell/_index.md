## Cell.next_cell property

Gets the next [Cell](../) node.


The method can be used when you need to have typed access to cells of a [Row](../../row/). If a
[StructuredDocumentTag](../../../aspose.words.markup/structureddocumenttag/) node is found in a row instead of a cell, it is automatically
traversed to get a cell contained within.
