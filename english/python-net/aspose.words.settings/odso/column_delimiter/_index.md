## Odso.column_delimiter property

Specifies the character which shall be interpreted as the column delimiter used to separate columns within external data sources.
The default value is 0 which means there is no column delimiter defined.


```python
@property
def column_delimiter(self) -> str:
    ...

@column_delimiter.setter
def column_delimiter(self, value: str):
    ...

```
