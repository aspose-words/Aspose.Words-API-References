## CompatibilityOptions.ui_compat_97_to_2003 property

**True** to disable UI functionality which is not compatible with Word97-2003.
Default value is **false**.


Controls the Word97-2003 compatibility setting that disables UI functionality which
is not compatible with Word97-2003.
When **true**, 'w:uiCompat97To2003' XML element is written to '\\word\\settings.xml'
document package part.
Default value is **false**. When set to **false**, this element is not written.

Technically this property is not part of compatibility options, but we have put it here for API convenience.
