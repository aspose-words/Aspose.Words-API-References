## Inline.parent_paragraph property

Retrieves the parent [Paragraph](../../paragraph/) of this node.



```python
@property
def parent_paragraph(self) -> aspose.words.Paragraph:
    ...

```

### Examples

Shows how to determine the revision type of an inline node.

```python
doc = aw.Document(MY_DIR + "Revision runs.docx")

# When we edit the document while the "Track Changes" option, found in via Review -> Tracking,
# is turned on in Microsoft Word, the changes we apply count as revisions.
# When editing a document using Aspose.Words, we can begin tracking revisions by
# invoking the document's "start_track_revisions" method and stop tracking by using the "stop_track_revisions" method.
# We can either accept revisions to assimilate them into the document
# or reject them to change the proposed change effectively.
self.assertEqual(6, doc.revisions.count)

# The parent node of a revision is the run that the revision concerns. A Run is an Inline node.
run = doc.revisions[0].parent_node.as_run()

first_paragraph = run.parent_paragraph
runs = first_paragraph.runs

self.assertEqual(6, len(runs.to_array()))

# Below are five types of revisions that can flag an Inline node.
# 1 -  An "insert" revision:
# This revision occurs when we insert text while tracking changes.
self.assertTrue(runs[2].is_insert_revision)

# 2 -  A "format" revision:
# This revision occurs when we change the formatting of text while tracking changes.
self.assertTrue(runs[2].is_format_revision)

# 3 -  A "move from" revision:
# When we highlight text in Microsoft Word, and then drag it to a different place in the document
# while tracking changes, two revisions appear.
# The "move from" revision is a copy of the text originally before we moved it.
self.assertTrue(runs[4].is_move_from_revision)

# 4 -  A "move to" revision:
# The "move to" revision is the text that we moved in its new position in the document.
# "Move from" and "move to" revisions appear in pairs for every move revision we carry out.
# Accepting a move revision deletes the "move from" revision and its text,
# and keeps the text from the "move to" revision.
# Rejecting a move revision conversely keeps the "move from" revision and deletes the "move to" revision.
self.assertTrue(runs[1].is_move_to_revision)

# 5 -  A "delete" revision:
# This revision occurs when we delete text while tracking changes. When we delete text like this,
# it will stay in the document as a revision until we either accept the revision,
# which will delete the text for good, or reject the revision, which will keep the text we deleted where it was.
self.assertTrue(runs[5].is_delete_revision)
```
