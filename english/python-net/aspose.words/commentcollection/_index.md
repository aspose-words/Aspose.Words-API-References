### Examples

Shows how to mark a comment as "done".

```python
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)
builder.writeln("Helo world!")

# Insert a comment to point out an error.
comment = aw.Comment(doc, "John Doe", "J.D.", datetime.now())
comment.set_text("Fix the spelling error!")
doc.first_section.body.first_paragraph.append_child(comment)

# Comments have a "done" flag, which is set to "False" by default.
# If a comment suggests that we make a change within the document,
# we can apply the change, and then also set the "done" flag afterwards to indicate the correction.
self.assertFalse(comment.done)

doc.first_section.body.first_paragraph.runs[0].text = "Hello world!"
comment.done = True

# Comments that are "done" will differentiate themselves
# from ones that are not "done" with a faded text color.
comment = aw.Comment(doc, "John Doe", "J.D.", datetime.now())
comment.set_text("Add text to this paragraph.")
builder.current_paragraph.append_child(comment)

doc.save(ARTIFACTS_DIR + "Comment.done.docx")
```
