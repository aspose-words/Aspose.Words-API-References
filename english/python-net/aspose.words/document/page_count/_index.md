## Document.page_count property

Gets the number of pages in the document as calculated by the most recent page layout operation.


```python
@property
def page_count(self) -> int:
    ...

```

### Examples

Shows how to count the number of pages in the document.

```python
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)
builder.write('Page 1')
builder.insert_break(aw.BreakType.PAGE_BREAK)
builder.write('Page 2')
builder.insert_break(aw.BreakType.PAGE_BREAK)
builder.write('Page 3')
# Verify the expected page count of the document.
self.assertEqual(3, doc.page_count)
# Getting the PageCount property invoked the document's page layout to calculate the value.
# This operation will not need to be re-done when rendering the document to a fixed page save format,
# such as .pdf. So you can save some time, especially with more complex documents.
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Document.GetPageCount.pdf')
```
