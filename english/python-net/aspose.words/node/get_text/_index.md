## get_text() {#default}

Gets the text of this node and of all its children.


```python
def get_text(self):
    ...
```

### Remarks

The returned string includes all control and special characters as described in [ControlChar](../../controlchar/).




### Examples

Shows how to use control characters.

```python
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)
# Insert paragraphs with text with DocumentBuilder.
builder.writeln('Hello world!')
builder.writeln('Hello again!')
# Converting the document to text form reveals that control characters
# represent some of the document's structural elements, such as page breaks.
self.assertEqual(f'Hello world!{aw.ControlChar.CR}' + f'Hello again!{aw.ControlChar.CR}' + aw.ControlChar.PAGE_BREAK, doc.get_text())
# When converting a document to string form,
# we can omit some of the control characters with the Trim method.
self.assertEqual(f'Hello world!{aw.ControlChar.CR}' + 'Hello again!', doc.get_text().strip())
```

Shows how to construct an Aspose.Words document by hand.

```python
doc = aw.Document()
# A blank document contains one section, one body and one paragraph.
# Call the "RemoveAllChildren" method to remove all those nodes,
# and end up with a document node with no children.
doc.remove_all_children()
# This document now has no composite child nodes that we can add content to.
# If we wish to edit it, we will need to repopulate its node collection.
# First, create a new section, and then append it as a child to the root document node.
section = aw.Section(doc)
doc.append_child(section)
# Set some page setup properties for the section.
section.page_setup.section_start = aw.SectionStart.NEW_PAGE
section.page_setup.paper_size = aw.PaperSize.LETTER
# A section needs a body, which will contain and display all its contents
# on the page between the section's header and footer.
body = aw.Body(doc)
section.append_child(body)
# Create a paragraph, set some formatting properties, and then append it as a child to the body.
para = aw.Paragraph(doc)
para.paragraph_format.style_name = 'Heading 1'
para.paragraph_format.alignment = aw.ParagraphAlignment.CENTER
body.append_child(para)
# Finally, add some content to do the document. Create a run,
# set its appearance and contents, and then append it as a child to the paragraph.
run = aw.Run(doc=doc)
run.text = 'Hello World!'
run.font.color = aspose.pydrawing.Color.red
para.append_child(run)
self.assertEqual('Hello World!', doc.get_text().strip())
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Section.CreateManually.docx')
```
