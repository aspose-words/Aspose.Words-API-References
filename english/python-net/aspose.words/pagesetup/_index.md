### Examples

Shows how to apply and revert page setup settings to sections in a document.

```python
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)
# Modify the page setup properties for the builder's current section and add text.
builder.page_setup.orientation = aw.Orientation.LANDSCAPE
builder.page_setup.vertical_alignment = aw.PageVerticalAlignment.CENTER
builder.writeln('This is the first section, which landscape oriented with vertically centered text.')
# If we start a new section using a document builder,
# it will inherit the builder's current page setup properties.
builder.insert_break(aw.BreakType.SECTION_BREAK_NEW_PAGE)
self.assertEqual(aw.Orientation.LANDSCAPE, doc.sections[1].page_setup.orientation)
self.assertEqual(aw.PageVerticalAlignment.CENTER, doc.sections[1].page_setup.vertical_alignment)
# We can revert its page setup properties to their default values using the "ClearFormatting" method.
builder.page_setup.clear_formatting()
self.assertEqual(aw.Orientation.PORTRAIT, doc.sections[1].page_setup.orientation)
self.assertEqual(aw.PageVerticalAlignment.TOP, doc.sections[1].page_setup.vertical_alignment)
