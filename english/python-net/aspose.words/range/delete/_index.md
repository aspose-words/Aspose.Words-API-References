```

### Examples

Shows how to delete all the nodes from a range.

doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)
# Add text to the first section in the document, and then add another section.
builder.write('Section 1. ')
builder.insert_break(aw.BreakType.SECTION_BREAK_CONTINUOUS)
builder.write('Section 2.')
self.assertEqual('Section 1. \x0cSection 2.', doc.get_text().strip())
# Remove the first section entirely by removing all the nodes
# within its range, including the section itself.
doc.sections[0].range.delete()
self.assertEqual(1, doc.sections.count)
self.assertEqual('Section 2.', doc.get_text().strip())
```
