## NodeList class

Represents a collection of nodes matching an XPath query executed using the [CompositeNode.select_nodes()](../compositenode/select_nodes/#str) method.
To learn more, visit the [Aspose.Words Document Object Model (DOM)](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose-words-document-object-model/) documentation article.




### Remarks

[NodeList](./) is returned by [CompositeNode.select_nodes()](../compositenode/select_nodes/#str) and contains a collection
of nodes matching the XPath query.

[NodeList](./) supports indexed access and iteration.

> **NOTE**
>
> Treat the [NodeList](./) collection as a "snapshot" collection. [NodeList](./) starts
> as a "live" collection because the nodes are not actually retrieved when the XPath query is run.
> The nodes are only retrieved upon access and at this time the node and all nodes that precede
> it are cached forming a "snapshot" collection.
