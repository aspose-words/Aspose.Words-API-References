## NodeList class

Represents a collection of nodes matching an XPath query executed using the [CompositeNode.select_nodes()](../compositenode/select_nodes/#str) method.



**NodeList** is returned by [CompositeNode.select_nodes()](../compositenode/select_nodes/#str) and contains a collection
of nodes matching the XPath query.

**NodeList** supports indexed access and iteration.

> **NOTE**
>
> Treat the **NodeList** collection as a "snapshot" collection. **NodeList** starts
> as a "live" collection because the nodes are not actually retrieved when the XPath query is run.
> The nodes are only retrieved upon access and at this time the node and all nodes that precede
> it are cached forming a "snapshot" collection.




### Indexers

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [``__getitem__(index)``](./__getitem__/#int) | Retrieves a node at the given index. |

### Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [count](./count/) | Gets the number of nodes in the list. |

### Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
|[ to_array()](./to_array/#default) | Copies all nodes from the collection to a new array of nodes. |

### Examples

Shows how to find all hyperlinks in a Word document, and then change their URLs and display names.

```python
class ExReplaceHyperlinks(ApiExampleBase):

    def test_fields(self):

        doc = aw.Document(MY_DIR + "Hyperlinks.docx")

        # Hyperlinks in a Word documents are fields. To begin looking for hyperlinks, we must first find all the fields.
        # Use the "select_nodes" method to find all the fields in the document via an XPath.
        field_starts = doc.select_nodes("//FieldStart")

        for field_start in field_starts:
            field_start = field_start.as_field_start()

            if field_start.field_type == aw.fields.FieldType.FIELD_HYPERLINK:
                hyperlink = Hyperlink(field_start)

                # Hyperlinks that link to bookmarks do not have URLs.
                if hyperlink.is_local:
                    continue

                # Give each URL hyperlink a new URL and name.
                hyperlink.target = "http://www.aspose.com"
                hyperlink.name = "Aspose - The .NET & Java Component Publisher"
