## FieldFileName class

Implements the FILENAME field.
To learn more, visit the [Working with Fields](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/working-with-fields/) documentation article.




### Remarks

Retrieves the name of the current document from its storage location.

In the current implementation, uses the [Document.original_file_name](../../aspose.words/document/original_file_name/) property to retrieve
the file name. If the document was loaded from a stream or created blank, uses the name of the file that is being saved to (if known).




**Inheritance:** [FieldFileName](./) → [Field](../field/)

### Constructors
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [FieldFileName()](./__init__/#default) | The default constructor. |

### Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [display_result](../field/display_result/) | Gets the text that represents the displayed field result.<br>(Inherited from [Field](../field/)) |
| [end](../field/end/) | Gets the node that represents the field end.<br>(Inherited from [Field](../field/)) |
| [format](../field/format/) | Gets a [FieldFormat](../fieldformat/) object that provides typed access to field's formatting.<br>(Inherited from [Field](../field/)) |
| [include_full_path](./include_full_path/) | Gets or sets whether to include the full file path name. |
| [is_dirty](../field/is_dirty/) | Gets or sets whether the current result of the field is no longer correct (stale) due to other modifications made to the document.<br>(Inherited from [Field](../field/)) |
| [is_locked](../field/is_locked/) | Gets or sets whether the field is locked (should not recalculate its result).<br>(Inherited from [Field](../field/)) |
| [locale_id](../field/locale_id/) | Gets or sets the LCID of the field.<br>(Inherited from [Field](../field/)) |
| [result](../field/result/) | Gets or sets text that is between the field separator and field end.<br>(Inherited from [Field](../field/)) |
| [separator](../field/separator/) | Gets the node that represents the field separator. Can be ``None``.<br>(Inherited from [Field](../field/)) |
| [start](../field/start/) | Gets the node that represents the start of the field.<br>(Inherited from [Field](../field/)) |
| [type](../field/type/) | Gets the Microsoft Word field type.<br>(Inherited from [Field](../field/)) |

### Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
|[ get_field_code()](../field/get_field_code/#default) | Returns text between field start and field separator (or field end if there is no separator). Both field code and field result of child fields are included.<br>(Inherited from [Field](../field/)) |
|[ get_field_code(include_child_field_codes)](../field/get_field_code/#bool) | Returns text between field start and field separator (or field end if there is no separator).<br>(Inherited from [Field](../field/)) |
|[ remove()](../field/remove/#default) | Removes the field from the document. Returns a node right after the field. If the field's end is the last child of its parent node, returns its parent paragraph. If the field is already removed, returns ``None``.<br>(Inherited from [Field](../field/)) |
|[ unlink()](../field/unlink/#default) | Performs the field unlink.<br>(Inherited from [Field](../field/)) |
|[ update()](../field/update/#default) | Performs the field update. Throws if the field is being updated already.<br>(Inherited from [Field](../field/)) |
|[ update(ignore_merge_format)](../field/update/#bool) | Performs a field update. Throws if the field is being updated already.<br>(Inherited from [Field](../field/)) |

### Examples

Shows how to use FieldOptions to override the default value for the FILENAME field.

```python
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Document.docx')
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc=doc)
builder.move_to_document_end()
builder.writeln()
# This FILENAME field will display the local system file name of the document we loaded.
field = builder.insert_field(field_type=aw.fields.FieldType.FIELD_FILE_NAME, update_field=True).as_field_file_name()
field.update()
self.assertEqual(' FILENAME ', field.get_field_code())
self.assertEqual('Document.docx', field.result)
builder.writeln()
# By default, the FILENAME field shows the file's name, but not its full local file system path.
# We can set a flag to make it show the full file path.
field = builder.insert_field(field_type=aw.fields.FieldType.FIELD_FILE_NAME, update_field=True).as_field_file_name()
field.include_full_path = True
field.update()
self.assertEqual(MY_DIR + 'Document.docx', field.result)
# We can also set a value for this property to
# override the value that the FILENAME field displays.
doc.field_options.file_name = 'FieldOptions.FILENAME.docx'
field.update()
self.assertEqual(' FILENAME  \\p', field.get_field_code())
self.assertEqual('FieldOptions.FILENAME.docx', field.result)
doc.update_fields()
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + doc.field_options.file_name)
```
