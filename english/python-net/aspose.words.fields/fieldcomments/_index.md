### Examples

Shows how to use the COMMENTS field.

```python
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc=doc)
# Set a value for the document's "Comments" built-in property.
doc.built_in_document_properties.comments = 'My comment.'
# Create a COMMENTS field to display the value of that built-in property.
field = builder.insert_field(field_type=aw.fields.FieldType.FIELD_COMMENTS, update_field=True).as_field_comments()
field.update()
self.assertEqual(' COMMENTS ', field.get_field_code())
self.assertEqual('My comment.', field.result)
# If we give the COMMENTS field's Text property value and update it, the field will
# overwrite the current value of the "Comments" built-in property with the value of its Text property,
# and then display the new value.
field.text = 'My overriding comment.'
field.update()
self.assertEqual(' COMMENTS  "My overriding comment."', field.get_field_code())
self.assertEqual('My overriding comment.', field.result)
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Field.COMMENTS.docx')
```
