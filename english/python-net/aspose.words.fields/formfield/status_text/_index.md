## FormField.status_text property

Returns or sets the text that's displayed in the status bar when a form field has the focus.

If the OwnStatus property is set to true, the StatusText property specifies the status bar text.
If the OwnStatus property is set to false, the StatusText property specifies the name of an AutoText
entry that contains status bar text for the form field.

Microsoft Word allows strings with at most 138 characters.
