## FormField.help_text property

Returns or sets the text that's displayed in a message box when the form field has the focus and the user presses F1.

If the [FormField.own_help](../own_help/) property is set to ``True``, [FormField.help_text](./) specifies the text string value.
If [FormField.own_help](../own_help/) is set to ``False``, [FormField.help_text](./) specifies the name of an AutoText entry that contains help
text for the form field.

Microsoft Word allows strings with at most 255 characters.
