## FormField.calculate_on_exit property

True if references to the specified form field are automatically updated whenever the field is exited.

Setting [FormField.calculate_on_exit](./) only affects the behavior of the form field when
the document is opened in Microsoft Word. Aspose.Words never updates references
to the form field.
