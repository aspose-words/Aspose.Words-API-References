Shows how to process an ADDIN field.

```python
doc = aw.Document(MY_DIR + "Field sample - ADDIN.docx")

# Aspose.Words does not support inserting ADDIN fields, but we can still load and read them.
field = doc.range.fields[0].as_field_add_in()

self.assertEqual(" ADDIN \"My value\" ", field.get_field_code())
```
