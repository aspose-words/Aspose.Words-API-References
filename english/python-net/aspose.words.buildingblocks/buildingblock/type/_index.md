## BuildingBlock.type property

Specifies the building block type.


```python
@property
def type(self) -> aspose.words.buildingblocks.BuildingBlockType:
    ...

@type.setter
def type(self, value: aspose.words.buildingblocks.BuildingBlockType):
    ...

```

The building block type can influence the visibility and behavior of the 
building block in Microsoft Word.
