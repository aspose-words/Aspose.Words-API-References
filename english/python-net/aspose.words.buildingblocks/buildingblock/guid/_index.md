## BuildingBlock.guid property

Gets or sets an identifier (a 128-bit GUID) that uniquely identifies this building block.

Can be used by an application to uniquely reference a building block regardless of
different naming due to localization.

Corresponds to the **docPartPr.guid** element in OOXML.
