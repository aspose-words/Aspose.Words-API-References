## \_\_getitem\_\_(index) {#int}

Retrieves a building block at the given index.


```python
def __getitem__(self, index: int):
    ...
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| index | int |  |

### Remarks

The index is zero-based.

Negative indexes are allowed and indicate access from the back of the collection. 
For example -1 means the last item, -2 means the second before last and so on.

If index is greater than or equal to the number of items in the list, this returns a null reference.

If index is negative and its absolute value is greater than the number of items in the list, this returns a null reference.
