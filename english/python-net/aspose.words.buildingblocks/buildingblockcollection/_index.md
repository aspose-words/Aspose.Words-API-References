## BuildingBlockCollection class

A collection of [BuildingBlock](../buildingblock/) objects in the document.
To learn more, visit the [Aspose.Words Document Object Model (DOM)](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/aspose-words-document-object-model/) documentation article.




You do not create instances of this class directly. To access a collection 
of building blocks use the [GlossaryDocument.building_blocks](../glossarydocument/building_blocks/) property.




**Inheritance:** [BuildingBlockCollection](./) → [NodeCollection](../../aspose.words/nodecollection/)
