## ImageSavingArgs.image_stream property

Allows to specify the stream where the image will be saved to.

This property allows you to save images to streams instead of files during HTML.

The default value is ``None``. When this property is ``None``, the image 
will be saved to a file specified in the [ImageSavingArgs.image_file_name](../image_file_name/) property.

Using [IImageSavingCallback](../../iimagesavingcallback/) you cannot substitute one image with 
another. It is intended only for control over location where to save images.
