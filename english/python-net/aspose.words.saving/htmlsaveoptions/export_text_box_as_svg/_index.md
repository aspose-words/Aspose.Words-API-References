## HtmlSaveOptions.export_text_box_as_svg property

Controls whether [Shape](../../../aspose.words.drawing/shape/) nodes that represent text boxes are converted to SVG images when saving
to HTML, MHTML or EPUB. 
Default value is ``false``.


If this option is set to ``true``, text boxes are exported as \<svg\> elements.
Otherwise, they are rendered to bitmaps and are exported as \<img\> elements.


Note that if [HtmlSaveOptions.export_shapes_as_svg](../export_shapes_as_svg/) is set to ``true``, text boxes will be exported as SVG even if this
property is set to ``false``.
