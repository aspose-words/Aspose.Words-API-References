## DownsampleOptions class

Allows to specify downsample options.
To learn more, visit the [Save a Document](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/save-a-document/) documentation article.




### Constructors
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DownsampleOptions()](./__init__/#default) | The default constructor. |

### Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [downsample_images](./downsample_images/) | Specifies whether images should be downsampled. |
| [resolution](./resolution/) | Specifies the resolution in pixels per inch which the images should be downsampled to. |
| [resolution_threshold](./resolution_threshold/) | Specifies the threshold resolution in pixels per inch. If resolution of an image in the document is less than threshold value,  the downsampling algorithm will not be applied. A value of 0 means the threshold check is not used and all images that can be reduced in size are downsampled. |

### Examples

Shows how to change the resolution of images in the PDF document.

```python
doc = aw.Document(MY_DIR + "Images.docx")

# Create a "PdfSaveOptions" object that we can pass to the document's "save" method
# to modify how that method converts the document to .PDF.
options = aw.saving.PdfSaveOptions()

# By default, Aspose.Words downsample all images in a document that we save to PDF to 220 ppi.
self.assertTrue(options.downsample_options.downsample_images)
self.assertEqual(220, options.downsample_options.resolution)
self.assertEqual(0, options.downsample_options.resolution_threshold)

doc.save(ARTIFACTS_DIR + "PdfSaveOptions.downsample_options.default.pdf", options)

# Set the "resolution" property to "36" to downsample all images to 36 ppi.
options.downsample_options.resolution = 36

# Set the "resolution_threshold" property to only apply the downsampling to
# images with a resolution that is above 128 ppi.
options.downsample_options.resolution_threshold = 128

# Only the first two images from the document will be downsampled at this stage.
doc.save(ARTIFACTS_DIR + "PdfSaveOptions.downsample_options.lower_resolution.pdf", options)
```
