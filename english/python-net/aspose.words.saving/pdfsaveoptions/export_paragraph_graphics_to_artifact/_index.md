## PdfSaveOptions.export_paragraph_graphics_to_artifact property

Gets or sets a value determining whether a paragraph graphic should be marked as an artifact.

Default value is ``False`` and paragraph graphics (underlines, text emphasis, etc.)
will be marked as "Span" in the logical structure of the document.

When the value is ``True`` the paragraph graphics will be marked as "Artifact".

This value is ignored when [PdfSaveOptions.export_document_structure](../export_document_structure/) is ``False``.
