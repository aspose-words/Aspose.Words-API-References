## HtmlFixedSaveOptions.resources_folder_alias property

Specifies the name of the folder used to construct image URIs written into an Html document.
Default is ``None``.


When you save a [Document](../../../aspose.words/document/) in Html format, Aspose.Words needs to save all
images embedded in the document as standalone files. [HtmlFixedSaveOptions.resources_folder](../resources_folder/)
allows you to specify where the images will be saved and [HtmlFixedSaveOptions.resources_folder_alias](./)
allows to specify how the image URIs will be constructed.
