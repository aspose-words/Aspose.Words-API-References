## SaveOptions.memory_optimization property

Gets or sets value determining if memory optimization should be performed before saving the document.
Default value for this property is ``False``.



```python
@property
def memory_optimization(self) -> bool:
    ...

@memory_optimization.setter
def memory_optimization(self, value: bool):
    ...

```

### Remarks

Setting this option to ``True`` can significantly decrease memory consumption while saving large documents at the cost of slower saving time.



### Examples

Shows an option to optimize memory consumption when rendering large documents to PDF.

```python
doc = aw.Document(file_name=MY_DIR + 'Rendering.docx')
# Create a "PdfSaveOptions" object that we can pass to the document's "Save" method
# to modify how that method converts the document to .PDF.
save_options = aw.saving.SaveOptions.create_save_options(save_format=aw.SaveFormat.PDF)
# Set the "MemoryOptimization" property to "true" to lower the memory footprint of large documents' saving operations
# at the cost of increasing the duration of the operation.
# Set the "MemoryOptimization" property to "false" to save the document as a PDF normally.
save_options.memory_optimization = memory_optimization
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'PdfSaveOptions.MemoryOptimization.pdf', save_options=save_options)
```
