This module contains classes of the Aspose.Words' new reporting engine that
supports report templates marked up with a language based on the LINQ Method Syntax.

This new reporting engine is more advanced than the original mail merge reporting engine
[aspose.words.mailmerging](../aspose.words.mailmerging/) and allows to retrieve data from any .NET class,
perform grouping, sorting, joining and interpret C# expressions.





## Classes

| [CsvDataSource](./csvdatasource/) | Provides access to data of a CSV file or stream to be used within a report. To learn more, visit the [LINQ Reporting Engine](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/linq-reporting-engine/) documentation article. |
| [JsonDataLoadOptions](./jsondataloadoptions/) | Represents options for parsing JSON data. To learn more, visit the [LINQ Reporting Engine](https://docs.aspose.com/words/python-net/linq-reporting-engine/) documentation article. |
