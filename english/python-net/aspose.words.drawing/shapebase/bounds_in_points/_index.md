## ShapeBase.bounds_in_points property

Gets the location and size of the containing block of the shape in points, relative to the anchor of the topmost shape.


```python
@property
def bounds_in_points(self) -> aspose.pydrawing.RectangleF:
    ...

```

### Remarks

The returned bounds do not include the rotation of this shape or the rotation of the parent group shape, if any.


### Examples

Shows how to verify shape containing block boundaries.

```python
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc=doc)
shape = builder.insert_shape(shape_type=aw.drawing.ShapeType.LINE, horz_pos=aw.drawing.RelativeHorizontalPosition.LEFT_MARGIN, left=50, vert_pos=aw.drawing.RelativeVerticalPosition.TOP_MARGIN, top=50, width=100, height=100, wrap_type=aw.drawing.WrapType.NONE)
shape.stroke_color = aspose.pydrawing.Color.orange
# Even though the line itself takes up little space on the document page,
# it occupies a rectangular containing block, the size of which we can determine using the "Bounds" properties.
self.assertEqual(aspose.pydrawing.RectangleF(50, 50, 100, 100), shape.bounds)
self.assertEqual(aspose.pydrawing.RectangleF(50, 50, 100, 100), shape.bounds_in_points)
# Create a group shape, and then set the size of its containing block using the "Bounds" property.
group = aw.drawing.GroupShape(doc)
group.bounds = aspose.pydrawing.RectangleF(0, 100, 250, 250)
self.assertEqual(aspose.pydrawing.RectangleF(0, 100, 250, 250), group.bounds_in_points)
# Create a rectangle, verify the size of its bounding block, and then add it to the group shape.
shape = aw.drawing.Shape(doc, aw.drawing.ShapeType.RECTANGLE)
shape.width = 100
shape.height = 100
shape.left = 700
shape.top = 700
self.assertEqual(aspose.pydrawing.RectangleF(700, 700, 100, 100), shape.bounds_in_points)
group.append_child(shape)
# The group shape's coordinate plane has its origin on the top left-hand side corner of its containing block,
# and the x and y coordinates of (1000, 1000) on the bottom right-hand side corner.
# Our group shape is 250x250pt in size, so every 4pt on the group shape's coordinate plane
# translates to 1pt in the document body's coordinate plane.
# Every shape that we insert will also shrink in size by a factor of 4.
# The change in the shape's "BoundsInPoints" property will reflect this.
self.assertEqual(aspose.pydrawing.RectangleF(175, 275, 25, 25), shape.bounds_in_points)
doc.first_section.body.first_paragraph.append_child(group)
# Insert a shape and place it outside of the bounds of the group shape's containing block.
shape = aw.drawing.Shape(doc, aw.drawing.ShapeType.RECTANGLE)
shape.width = 100
shape.height = 100
shape.left = 1000
shape.top = 1000
group.append_child(shape)
# The group shape's footprint in the document body has increased, but the containing block remains the same.
self.assertEqual(aspose.pydrawing.RectangleF(0, 100, 250, 250), group.bounds_in_points)
self.assertEqual(aspose.pydrawing.RectangleF(250, 350, 25, 25), shape.bounds_in_points)
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Shape.Bounds.docx')
```
