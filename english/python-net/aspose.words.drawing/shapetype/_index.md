### Examples

Shows how to insert a shape with an image from the local file system into a document.

```python
doc = aw.Document()
# The "Shape" class's public constructor will create a shape with "ShapeMarkupLanguage.Vml" markup type.
# If you need to create a shape of a non-primitive type, such as SingleCornerSnipped, TopCornersSnipped, DiagonalCornersSnipped,
# TopCornersOneRoundedOneSnipped, SingleCornerRounded, TopCornersRounded, or DiagonalCornersRounded,
# please use DocumentBuilder.InsertShape.
shape = aw.drawing.Shape(doc, aw.drawing.ShapeType.IMAGE)
shape.image_data.set_image(file_name=IMAGE_DIR + 'Windows MetaFile.wmf')
shape.width = 100
shape.height = 100
doc.first_section.body.first_paragraph.append_child(shape)
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Image.FromFile.docx')
```

Shows how Aspose.Words identify shapes.

```python
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc=doc)
builder.insert_shape(shape_type=aw.drawing.ShapeType.HEPTAGON, horz_pos=aw.drawing.RelativeHorizontalPosition.PAGE, left=0, vert_pos=aw.drawing.RelativeVerticalPosition.PAGE, top=0, width=0, height=0, wrap_type=aw.drawing.WrapType.NONE)
builder.insert_shape(shape_type=aw.drawing.ShapeType.CLOUD, horz_pos=aw.drawing.RelativeHorizontalPosition.RIGHT_MARGIN, left=0, vert_pos=aw.drawing.RelativeVerticalPosition.PAGE, top=0, width=0, height=0, wrap_type=aw.drawing.WrapType.NONE)
builder.insert_shape(shape_type=aw.drawing.ShapeType.MATH_PLUS, horz_pos=aw.drawing.RelativeHorizontalPosition.RIGHT_MARGIN, left=0, vert_pos=aw.drawing.RelativeVerticalPosition.PAGE, top=0, width=0, height=0, wrap_type=aw.drawing.WrapType.NONE)
# To correct identify shape types you need to work with shapes as DML.
save_options = aw.saving.OoxmlSaveOptions(aw.SaveFormat.DOCX)
save_options.compliance = aw.saving.OoxmlCompliance.ISO29500_2008_TRANSITIONAL
doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Shape.ShapeTypes.docx', save_options=save_options)
doc = aw.Document(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Shape.ShapeTypes.docx')
shapes = list(filter(lambda a: a is not None, map(lambda b: system_helper.linq.Enumerable.of_type(lambda x: x.as_shape(), b), list(doc.get_child_nodes(aw.NodeType.SHAPE, True)))))
for shape in shapes:
    print(shape.shape_type)
```
