### Examples

Shows how to insert a shape with an image from the local file system into a document.

```python
doc = aw.Document()

# The "Shape" class's public constructor will create a shape with "ShapeMarkupLanguage.VML" markup type.
# If you need to create a shape of a non-primitive type, such as SingleCornerSnipped, TopCornersSnipped, DiagonalCornersSnipped,
# TopCornersOneRoundedOneSnipped, SingleCornerRounded, TopCornersRounded, or DiagonalCornersRounded,
# please use DocumentBuilder.insert_shape.
shape = aw.drawing.Shape(doc, aw.drawing.ShapeType.IMAGE)
shape.image_data.set_image(IMAGE_DIR + "Windows MetaFile.wmf")
shape.width = 100
shape.height = 100

doc.first_section.body.first_paragraph.append_child(shape)

doc.save(ARTIFACTS_DIR + "Image.from_file.docx")
```

Shows how Aspose.Words identify shapes.

```python
doc = aw.Document()
builder = aw.DocumentBuilder(doc)

builder.insert_shape(aw.drawing.ShapeType.HEPTAGON, aw.drawing.RelativeHorizontalPosition.PAGE, 0,
    aw.drawing.RelativeVerticalPosition.PAGE, 0, 0, 0, aw.drawing.WrapType.NONE)

builder.insert_shape(aw.drawing.ShapeType.CLOUD, aw.drawing.RelativeHorizontalPosition.RIGHT_MARGIN, 0,
    aw.drawing.RelativeVerticalPosition.PAGE, 0, 0, 0, aw.drawing.WrapType.NONE)

builder.insert_shape(aw.drawing.ShapeType.MATH_PLUS, aw.drawing.RelativeHorizontalPosition.RIGHT_MARGIN, 0,
    aw.drawing.RelativeVerticalPosition.PAGE, 0, 0, 0, aw.drawing.WrapType.NONE)

# To correct identify shape types you need to work with shapes as DML.
save_options = aw.saving.OoxmlSaveOptions(aw.SaveFormat.DOCX)

# "Strict" or "Transitional" compliance allows to save shape as DML.
save_options.compliance = aw.saving.OoxmlCompliance.ISO29500_2008_TRANSITIONAL

doc.save(ARTIFACTS_DIR + "Shape.shape_types.docx", save_options)
doc = aw.Document(ARTIFACTS_DIR + "Shape.shape_types.docx")

shapes = [node.as_shape() for node in doc.get_child_nodes(aw.NodeType.SHAPE, True)]

for shape in shapes:
    print(shape.shape_type)
```
