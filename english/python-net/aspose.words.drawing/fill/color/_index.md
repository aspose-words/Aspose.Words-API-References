## Fill.color property

Gets or sets a Color object that represents the foreground color for the fill.


```python
@property
def color(self) -> aspose.pydrawing.Color:
    ...

@color.setter
def color(self, value: aspose.pydrawing.Color):
    ...

```

### Remarks

This property preserves the alpha component of the aspose.pydrawing.Color,
unlike the [Fill.fore_color](../fore_color/) property, which resets it to fully opaque color.
