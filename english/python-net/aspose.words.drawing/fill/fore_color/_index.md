## Fill.fore_color property

Gets or sets a Color object that represents the foreground color for the fill.


```python
@property
def fore_color(self) -> aspose.pydrawing.Color:
    ...

@fore_color.setter
def fore_color(self, value: aspose.pydrawing.Color):
    ...

```

### Remarks

This property resets the alpha component of the aspose.pydrawing.Color
to fully opaque color unlike the [Fill.color](../color/) property, which preserves it.
