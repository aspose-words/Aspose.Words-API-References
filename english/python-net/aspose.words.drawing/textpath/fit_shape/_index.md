## TextPath.fit_shape property

Defines whether the text fits bounding box of a shape.


```python
@property
def fit_shape(self) -> bool:
    ...

@fit_shape.setter
def fit_shape(self, value: bool):
    ...

```

### Remarks

The default value is ``False``.




### Examples

Shows how to work with WordArt.

```python
doc = aw.Document()
# Insert a WordArt object to display text in a shape that we can re-size and move by using the mouse in Microsoft Word.
# Provide a "ShapeType" as an argument to set a shape for the WordArt.
shape = ExShape._append_word_art(doc, 'Hello World! This text is bold, and italic.', 'Arial', 480, 24, aspose.pydrawing.Color.white, aspose.pydrawing.Color.black, aw.drawing.ShapeType.TEXT_PLAIN_TEXT)
# Apply the "Bold" and "Italic" formatting settings to the text using the respective properties.
shape.text_path.bold = True
shape.text_path.italic = True
# Below are various other text formatting-related properties.

# Use the "Kerning" property to enable/disable kerning spacing between certain characters.
shape = ExShape._append_word_art(doc, 'Kerning: VAV', 'Times New Roman', 90, 24, aspose.pydrawing.Color.orange, aspose.pydrawing.Color.red, aw.drawing.ShapeType.TEXT_PLAIN_TEXT)

shape.text_path.same_letter_heights = True
# By default, the text's size will always scale to fit the containing shape's size, overriding the text size setting.

self.assertTrue(shape.text_path.fit_shape)
shape.text_path.size = 24
# If we set the "FitShape: property to "false", the text will keep the size
# which the "Size" property specifies regardless of the size of the shape.
# Use the "TextPathAlignment" property also to align the text to a side of the shape.
shape = ExShape._append_word_art(doc, 'FitShape off', 'Calibri', 160, 24, aspose.pydrawing.Color.light_blue, aspose.pydrawing.Color.blue, aw.drawing.ShapeType.TEXT_PLAIN_TEXT)

doc.save(file_name=ARTIFACTS_DIR + 'Shape.InsertTextPaths.docx')
```

Shows how to work with WordArt (AppendWordArt).

```python
@staticmethod
def _append_word_art(doc, text, text_font_family, shape_width, shape_height, word_art_fill, line, word_art_shape_type):
    # Create an inline Shape, which will serve as a container for our WordArt.
    # The shape can only be a valid WordArt shape if we assign a WordArt-designated ShapeType to it.
    # These types will have "WordArt object" in the description,
    # and their enumerator constant names will all start with "Text".
    shape = aw.drawing.Shape(doc, word_art_shape_type)
    shape.wrap_type = aw.drawing.WrapType.INLINE
    shape.width = shape_width
    shape.height = shape_height
    shape.fill_color = word_art_fill
    shape.stroke_color = line
    shape.text_path.text = text
    shape.text_path.font_family = text_font_family
    para = doc.first_section.body.append_child(aw.Paragraph(doc)).as_paragraph()
    para.append_child(shape)
    return shape
