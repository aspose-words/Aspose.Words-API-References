## ImageFieldMergingArgs.shape property

Specifies the shape that the mail merge engine must insert into the document.

When this property is specified, the mail merge engine ignores all other properties like [ImageFieldMergingArgs.image_file_name](../image_file_name/) or [ImageFieldMergingArgs.image_stream](../image_stream/)
and simply inserts the shape into the document.

Use this property to fully control the process of merging an image merge field.
For example, you can specify [ShapeBase.wrap_type](../../../aspose.words.drawing/shapebase/wrap_type/) or any other shape property to fine tune the resulting node. However, please note that
you are responsible for providing the content of the shape.
