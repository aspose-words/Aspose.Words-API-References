## ImageFieldMergingArgs.image_height property

Specifies the image height for the image to insert into the document.

The value of this property initially comes from the corresponding MERGEFIELD's code, contained in the
template document. To override the initial value, you should assign an instance of
[MergeFieldImageDimension](../../../aspose.words.fields/mergefieldimagedimension/) class to this property or set the properties for the instance
of [MergeFieldImageDimension](../../../aspose.words.fields/mergefieldimagedimension/) class, returned by this property.


To indicate that the original value of the image height should be applied, you should assign the ``None``
value to this property or set the [MergeFieldImageDimension.value](../../../aspose.words.fields/mergefieldimagedimension/value/) property for the instance
of [MergeFieldImageDimension](../../../aspose.words.fields/mergefieldimagedimension/) class, returned by this property, to a negative value.
