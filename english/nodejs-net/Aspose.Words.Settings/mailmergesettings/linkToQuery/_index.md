## MailMergeSettings.linkToQuery property

Not sure about this one.
The Microsoft Word Automation Reference suggests that this specifies that the query is executed every time the document 
is opened in Microsoft Word. But the OOXML specification suggests that this specifies that the query contains a reference
to an external query file which contains the actual query.
The default value is ``false``.



```js
get linkToQuery(): boolean
```
