### Examples

Shows how to traverse through a composite node's collection of child nodes.

```js
let doc = new aw.Document();

// Add two runs and one shape as child nodes to the first paragraph of this document.
let paragraph = doc.getParagraph(0, true);
paragraph.appendChild(new aw.Run(doc, "Hello world! "));

let shape = new aw.Drawing.Shape(doc, aw.Drawing.ShapeType.Rectangle);
shape.width = 200;
shape.height = 200;
// Note that the 'CustomNodeId' is not saved to an output file and exists only during the node lifetime.
shape.customNodeId = 100;
shape.wrapType = aw.Drawing.WrapType.Inline;
paragraph.appendChild(shape);

paragraph.appendChild(new aw.Run(doc, "Hello again!"));

// Iterate through the paragraph's collection of immediate children,
// and print any runs or shapes that we find within.
let children = paragraph.getChildNodes(aw.NodeType.Any, false);

expect(paragraph.getChildNodes(aw.NodeType.Any, false).count).toEqual(3);

for (let child of children)
  switch (child.nodeType)
  {
    case aw.NodeType.Run:
      console.log("Run contents:");
      console.log(`\t\"${child.getText().trim()}\"`);
      break;
    case aw.NodeType.Shape:
      let childShape = child.asShape();
      console.log("Shape:");
      console.log(`\t${childShape.shapeType}, ${childShape.width}x${childShape.height}`);
      expect(shape.customNodeId).toEqual(100);
      break;
  }
```
