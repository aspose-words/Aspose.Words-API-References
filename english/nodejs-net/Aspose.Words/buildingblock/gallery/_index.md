## BuildingBlock.gallery property

Specifies the first-level categorization for the building block for the purposes of 
classification or user interface sorting.


```js
get gallery(): Aspose.Words.BuildingBlocks.BuildingBlockGallery
```

### Remarks

Building blocks in Microsoft Word user interface are arranged 
into Galleries. Each [BuildingBlock.gallery](./) can have multiple Categories. Each block within
a [BuildingBlock.category](../category/) has a [BuildingBlock.name](../name/).

Corresponds to the **docPartPr.category.gallery** element in OOXML.
