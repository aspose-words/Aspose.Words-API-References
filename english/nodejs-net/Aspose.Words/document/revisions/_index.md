## Document.revisions property

Gets a collection of revisions (tracked changes) that exist in this document.


```js
get revisions(): Aspose.Words.RevisionCollection
```

### Remarks

The returned collection is a "live" collection, which means if you remove parts of a document that contain
revisions, the deleted revisions will automatically disappear from this collection.
