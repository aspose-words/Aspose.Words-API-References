## Document.versionsCount property

Gets the number of document versions that was stored in the DOC document.


```js
get versionsCount(): number
```

### Remarks

Versions in Microsoft Word are accessed via the File/Versions menu. Microsoft Word supports
versions only for DOC files.

This property allows to detect if there were document versions stored in this document
before it was opened in Aspose.Words. Aspose.Words provides no other support for document versions.
If you save this document using Aspose.Words, the document will be saved without versions.
