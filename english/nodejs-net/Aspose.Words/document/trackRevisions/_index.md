## Document.trackRevisions property

True if changes are tracked when this document is edited in Microsoft Word.


```js
get trackRevisions(): boolean
```

### Remarks

Setting this option only instructs Microsoft Word whether the track changes
is turned on or off. This property has no effect on changes to the document that you make
programmatically via Aspose.Words.

If you want to automatically track changes as they are made programmatically by Aspose.Words
to this document use the [Document.startTrackRevisions()](../startTrackRevisions/#string_date) method.
