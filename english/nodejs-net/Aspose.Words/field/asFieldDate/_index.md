## asFieldDate() {#default}

Cast field to [FieldDate](../../../aspose.words.fields/fielddate/).



```js
asFieldDate()
```

### Remarks

If a method returns a base class object, you should explicitly cast it to the derived class
for access to the derived class members. Otherwise, you will only be able to access the members of the base class.
