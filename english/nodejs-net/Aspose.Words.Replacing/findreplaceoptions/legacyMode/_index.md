## FindReplaceOptions.legacyMode property

Gets or sets a boolean value indicating that old find/replace algorithm is used.


```js
get legacyMode(): boolean
```

### Remarks

Use this flag if you need exactly the same behavior as before advanced find/replace feature was introduced.
Note that old algorithm does not support advanced features such as replace with breaks, apply formatting and so on.
