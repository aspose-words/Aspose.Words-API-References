## XamlFlowSaveOptions.replaceBackslashWithYenSign property

Specifies whether backslash characters should be replaced with yen signs.
Default value is ``False``.



```js
get replaceBackslashWithYenSign(): boolean
```

### Remarks

By default, Aspose.Words mimics MS Word's behavior and doesn't replace backslash characters with yen signs in
generated XAML documents. However, previous versions of Aspose.Words performed such replacements in certain
scenarios. This flag enables backward compatibility with previous versions of Aspose.Words.
