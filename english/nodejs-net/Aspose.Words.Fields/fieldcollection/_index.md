## FieldCollection class

A collection of [Field](../../aspose.words/field/) objects that represents the fields in the specified range.
To learn more, visit the [Working with Fields](https://docs.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/working-with-fields/) documentation article.




### Remarks

An instance of this collection iterates fields which start fall within the specified range.

The [FieldCollection](./) collection does not own the fields it contains, rather, is just a selection of fields.

The [FieldCollection](./) collection is "live", i.e. changes to the children of the node object
that it was created from are immediately reflected in the fields returned by the [FieldCollection](./)
properties and methods.
