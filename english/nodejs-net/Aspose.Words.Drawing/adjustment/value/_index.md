## Adjustment.value property

Gets or sets the raw value of the adjustment.


```js
get value(): number
```

### Remarks

An adjust value is simply a guide that has a value based formula specified.
That is, no calculation takes place for an adjust value guide.
Instead, this guide specifies a parameter value that is used for calculations within the shape guides.
