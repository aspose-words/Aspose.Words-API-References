```js
let doc = new aw.Document();

// The "Shape" class's public constructor will create a shape with "ShapeMarkupLanguage.Vml" markup type.
// If you need to create a shape of a non-primitive type, such as SingleCornerSnipped, TopCornersSnipped, DiagonalCornersSnipped,
// TopCornersOneRoundedOneSnipped, SingleCornerRounded, TopCornersRounded, or DiagonalCornersRounded,
// please use aw.DocumentBuilder.insertShape.
let shape = new aw.Drawing.Shape(doc, aw.Drawing.ShapeType.Image);
shape.imageData.setImage(base.imageDir + "Windows MetaFile.wmf");
shape.width = 100;
shape.height = 100;
