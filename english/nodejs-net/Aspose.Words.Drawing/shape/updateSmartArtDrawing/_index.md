## updateSmartArtDrawing() {#default}

Updates SmartArt pre-rendered drawing by using Aspose.Words's SmartArt cold rendering engine.


```js
updateSmartArtDrawing()
```

### Remarks

Microsoft Word generates and saves the pre-rendered drawing along with SmartArt object. However,
if the document is saved by other applications, the pre-rendered SmartArt drawing may be missing or incorrect.
If pre-rendered drawing is available then Aspose.Words uses it to render the SmartArt object.
If pre-rendered drawing is missing then Aspose.Words uses its own SmartArt cold rendering engine to render the
SmartArt object.
If pre-rendered drawing is incorrect then it is required to call this method to invoke the SmartArt cold
rendering engine.
