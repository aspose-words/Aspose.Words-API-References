## TextPath class

Defines the text and formatting of the text path (of a WordArt object).
To learn more, visit the [Working with Shapes](https://docs.aspose.com/words/nodejs-net/working-with-shapes/) documentation article.




### Remarks

Use the [Shape.textPath](../shape/textPath/) property to access WordArt properties of a shape.
You do not create instances of the [TextPath](./) class directly.
