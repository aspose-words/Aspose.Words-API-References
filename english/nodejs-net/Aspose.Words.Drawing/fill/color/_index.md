## Fill.color property

Gets or sets a Color object that represents the foreground color for the fill.


```js
get color(): string
```

### Remarks

This property preserves the alpha component of the aspose.pydrawing.Color,
unlike the [Fill.foreColor](../foreColor/) property, which resets it to fully opaque color.
