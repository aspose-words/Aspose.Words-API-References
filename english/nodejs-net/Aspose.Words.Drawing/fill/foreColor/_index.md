## Fill.foreColor property

Gets or sets a Color object that represents the foreground color for the fill.


```js
get foreColor(): string
```

### Remarks

This property resets the alpha component of the aspose.pydrawing.Color
to fully opaque color unlike the [Fill.color](../color/) property, which preserves it.
