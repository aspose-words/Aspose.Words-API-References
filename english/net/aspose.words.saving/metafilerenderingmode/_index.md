## MetafileRenderingMode enumeration

Specifies how Aspose.Words should render WMF and EMF metafiles.

```csharp
public enum MetafileRenderingMode
```

## Values

| name | value | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VectorWithFallback | `0` | Aspose.Words tries to render a metafile as vector graphics. If Aspose.Words cannot correctly render some of the metafile records to vector graphics then Aspose.Words renders this metafile to a bitmap. |
| Vector | `1` | Aspose.Words renders a metafile as vector graphics. |
| Bitmap | `2` | Aspose.Words invokes GDI+ to render a metafile to a bitmap and then saves the bitmap to the output document. |
