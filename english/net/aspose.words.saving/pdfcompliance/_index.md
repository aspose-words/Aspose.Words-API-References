| Pdf20 | `1` | The output file will comply with the PDF 2.0 (ISO 32000-2) standard. |
| PdfA1a | `2` | The output file will comply with the PDF/A-1a (ISO 19005-1) standard. This level includes all the requirements of PDF/A-1b and additionally requires that document structure be included (also known as being "tagged"), with the objective of ensuring that document content can be searched and repurposed. |
| PdfA1b | `3` | The output file will comply with the PDF/A-1b (ISO 19005-1) standard. PDF/A-1b has the objective of ensuring reliable reproduction of the visual appearance of the document. |

This level includes all the requirements of PDF/A-2u and additionally requires that document structure be included (also known as being "tagged"), with the objective of ensuring that document content can be searched and repurposed. |
| PdfA2u | `5` | The output file will comply with the PDF/A-2u (ISO 19005-2) standard. PDF/A-2u has the objective of preserving document static visual appearance over time, independent of the tools and systems used for creating, storing or rendering the files. Additionally any text contained in the document can be reliably extracted as a series of Unicode codepoints. |
| PdfA4 | `6` | The output file will comply with the PDF/A-4 (ISO 19005-4:2020) standard.

## Examples

Shows how to set the PDF standards compliance level of saved PDF documents.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Images.docx");

// Create a "PdfSaveOptions" object that we can pass to the document's "Save" method
// to modify how that method converts the document to .PDF.
// Note that some PdfSaveOptions are prohibited when saving to one of the standards and automatically fixed.
// Use IWarningCallback to know which options are automatically fixed.
PdfSaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions();

// Set the "Compliance" property to "PdfCompliance.PdfA1b" to comply with the "PDF/A-1b" standard,
// which aims to preserve the visual appearance of the document as Aspose.Words convert it to PDF.
// Set the "Compliance" property to "PdfCompliance.Pdf17" to comply with the "1.7" standard.
// Set the "Compliance" property to "PdfCompliance.PdfA1a" to comply with the "PDF/A-1a" standard,
// which complies with "PDF/A-1b" as well as preserving the document structure of the original document.
// Set the "Compliance" property to "PdfCompliance.PdfUa1" to comply with the "PDF/UA-1" (ISO 14289-1) standard,
// which aims to define represent electronic documents in PDF that allow the file to be accessible.
// Set the "Compliance" property to "PdfCompliance.Pdf20" to comply with the "PDF 2.0" (ISO 32000-2) standard.
// Set the "Compliance" property to "PdfCompliance.PdfA4" to comply with the "PDF/A-4" (ISO 19004:2020) standard,
// which preserving document static visual appearance over time.
// This helps with making documents searchable but may significantly increase the size of already large documents.
saveOptions.Compliance = pdfCompliance;

doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "PdfSaveOptions.Compliance.pdf", saveOptions);
```
