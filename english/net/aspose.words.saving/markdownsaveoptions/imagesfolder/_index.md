## MarkdownSaveOptions.ImagesFolder property

Specifies the physical folder where images are saved when exporting a document to the Markdown format. Default is an empty string.

```csharp
public string ImagesFolder { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

When you save a [`Document`](../../../aspose.words/document) in Markdown format, Aspose.Words needs to save all images embedded in the document as standalone files. `ImagesFolder` allows you to specify where the images will be saved.

If you save a document into a file and provide a file name, Aspose.Words, by default, saves the images in the same folder where the document file is saved. Use `ImagesFolder` to override this behavior.

If you save a document into a stream, Aspose.Words does not have a folder where to save the images, but still needs to save the images somewhere. In this case, you need to specify an accessible folder in the `ImagesFolder` property.

If the folder specified by `ImagesFolder` doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.
