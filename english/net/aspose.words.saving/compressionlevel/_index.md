## CompressionLevel enumeration

Compression level for OOXML files.

(DOCX and DOTX files are internally a ZIP-archive, this property controls the compression level of the archive.

Note, that FlatOpc file is not a ZIP-archive, therefore, this property does not affect the FlatOpc files.)

```csharp
public enum CompressionLevel
```

## Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal | `0` | Normal compression level. Default compression level used by Aspose.Words. |
| Maximum | `1` | Maximum compression level. |
| Fast | `2` | Fast compression level. |
| SuperFast | `3` | Super Fast compression level. Microsoft Word uses this compression level. |
