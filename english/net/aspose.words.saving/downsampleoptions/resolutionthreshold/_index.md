## DownsampleOptions.ResolutionThreshold property

Specifies the threshold resolution in pixels per inch. If resolution of an image in the document is less than threshold value, the downsampling algorithm will not be applied. A value of 0 means the threshold check is not used and all images that can be reduced in size are downsampled.

```csharp
public int ResolutionThreshold { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

The default value is 0.
