## XamlFixedSaveOptions.ResourcesFolder property

Specifies the physical folder where resources (images and fonts) are saved when exporting a document to fixed page Xaml format. Default is `null`.

```csharp
public string ResourcesFolder { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

When you save a [`Document`](../../../aspose.words/document) in fixed page Xaml format, Aspose.Words needs to save all images embedded in the document as standalone files. `ResourcesFolder` allows you to specify where the images will be saved and [`ResourcesFolderAlias`](../resourcesfolderalias) allows to specify how the image URIs will be constructed.If you save a document into a file and provide a file name, Aspose.Words, by default, saves the images in the same folder where the document file is saved. Use `ResourcesFolder` to override this behavior.If you save a document into a stream, Aspose.Words does not have a folder where to save the images, but still needs to save the images somewhere. In this case, you need to specify an accessible folder by using the `ResourcesFolder` property
