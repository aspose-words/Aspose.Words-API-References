## ResourceSavingArgs.KeepResourceStreamOpen property

Specifies whether Aspose.Words should keep the stream open or close it after saving a resource.

```csharp
public bool KeepResourceStreamOpen { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Default is `false` and Aspose.Words will close the stream you provided in the [`ResourceStream`](../resourcestream) property after writing a resource into it. Specify `true` to keep the stream open.
