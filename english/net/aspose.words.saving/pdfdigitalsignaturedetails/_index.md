### Remarks

At the moment digitally signing PDF documents is only available on .NET 2.0 or higher.

To digitally sign a PDF document when it is created by Aspose.Words, set the [`DigitalSignatureDetails`](../pdfsaveoptions/digitalsignaturedetails) property to a valid [`PdfDigitalSignatureDetails`](../pdfdigitalsignaturedetails) object and then save the document in the PDF format passing the [`PdfSaveOptions`](../pdfsaveoptions) as a parameter into the [`Save`](../../aspose.words/document/save) method.

Aspose.Words creates a PKCS#7 signature over the whole PDF document and uses the "Adobe.PPKMS" filter and "adbe.pkcs7.sha1" subfilter when creating a digital signature.
