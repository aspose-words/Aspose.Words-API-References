## PdfEncryptionDetails.OwnerPassword property

Specifies the owner password for the encrypted PDF document.

```csharp
public string OwnerPassword { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

The owner password allows the user to open an encrypted PDF document without any access restrictions specified in [`Permissions`](../permissions/).

The owner password cannot be the same as the user password.

## Examples

Shows how to set permissions on a saved PDF document.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

builder.Writeln("Hello world!");

PdfEncryptionDetails encryptionDetails =
    new PdfEncryptionDetails("password", string.Empty);

// Start by disallowing all permissions.
encryptionDetails.Permissions = PdfPermissions.DisallowAll;

// Extend permissions to allow the editing of annotations.
encryptionDetails.Permissions = PdfPermissions.ModifyAnnotations | PdfPermissions.DocumentAssembly;

// Create a "PdfSaveOptions" object that we can pass to the document's "Save" method
// to modify how that method converts the document to .PDF.
PdfSaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions();

// Enable encryption via the "EncryptionDetails" property.
saveOptions.EncryptionDetails = encryptionDetails;

// When we open this document, we will need to provide the password before accessing its contents.
doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "PdfSaveOptions.EncryptionPermissions.pdf", saveOptions);
```
