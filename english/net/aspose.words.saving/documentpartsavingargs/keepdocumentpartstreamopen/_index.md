## DocumentPartSavingArgs.KeepDocumentPartStreamOpen property

Specifies whether Aspose.Words should keep the stream open or close it after saving a document part.

```csharp
public bool KeepDocumentPartStreamOpen { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Default is `false` and Aspose.Words will close the stream you provided in the [`DocumentPartStream`](../documentpartstream) property after writing a document part into it. Specify `true` to keep the stream open. Please note that the main output stream provided in the call to [`Save`](../../../aspose.words/document/save) or [`Save`](../../../aspose.words/document/save) will never be closed by Aspose.Words even if `KeepDocumentPartStreamOpen` is set to `false`.
