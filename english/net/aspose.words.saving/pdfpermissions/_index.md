## PdfPermissions enumeration

Specifies the operations that are allowed to a user on an encrypted PDF document.

```csharp
[Flags]
public enum PdfPermissions
```

## Values

| name | value | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DisallowAll | `0x0` | Disallows all operations on the PDF document. This is the default value. |
| AllowAll | `0xFFFF` | Allows all operations on the PDF document. |
| ContentCopy | `0x10` | Copy or otherwise extract text and graphics from the document by operations other than that controlled by ContentCopyForAccessibility. |
| ContentCopyForAccessibility | `0x200` | Extract text and graphics (in support of accessibility to users with disabilities or for other purposes). |
| ModifyContents | `0x8` | Modify the contents of the document by operations other than those controlled by ModifyAnnotations, FillIn, and DocumentAssembly. |
| ModifyAnnotations | `0x20` | Add or modify text annotations, fill in interactive form fields, and, if ModifyContents is also set, create or modify interactive form fields (including signature fields). |
| FillIn | `0x100` | Fill in existing interactive form fields (including signature fields), even if ModifyContents is clear. |
| DocumentAssembly | `0x400` | Assemble the document (insert, rotate, or delete pages and create document outline items or thumbnail images), even if ModifyContents is clear. |
| Printing | `0x4` | Print the document (possibly not at the highest quality level, depending on whether HighResolutionPrinting is also set). |
| HighResolutionPrinting | `0x804` | Print the document to a representation from which a faithful digital copy of the PDF content could be generated, based on an implementation-dependent algorithm. When this flag is clear (and Printing is set), printing shall be limited to a low-level representation of the appearance, possibly of degraded quality. |
