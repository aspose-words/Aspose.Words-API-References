## FontSavingArgs.IsSubsettingNeeded property

Allows to specify whether the current font will be subsetted before exporting as a font resource.

```csharp
public bool IsSubsettingNeeded { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Fonts can be exported as complete original font files or subsetted to include only the characters that are used in the document. Subsetting allows to reduce the resulting font resource size.

By default, Aspose.Words decides whether to perform subsetting or not by comparing the original font file size with the one specified in [`FontResourcesSubsettingSizeThreshold`](../../htmlsaveoptions/fontresourcessubsettingsizethreshold). You can override this behavior for individual fonts by setting the `IsSubsettingNeeded` property.
