## ImageSaveOptions.UseGdiEmfRenderer property

Gets or sets a value determining whether to use GDI+ or Aspose.Words metafile renderer when saving to EMF.

```csharp
public bool UseGdiEmfRenderer { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

If set to `true` GDI+ metafile renderer is used. I.e. content is written to GDI+ graphics object and saved to metafile.

If set to `false` Aspose.Words metafile renderer is used. I.e. content is written directly to the metafile format with Aspose.Words.

Has effect only when saving to EMF.

GDI+ saving works only on .NET.

The default value is `true`.
