## HtmlSaveOptions.ExportPageSetup property

Specifies whether page setup is exported to HTML, MHTML or EPUB. Default is `false`.

```csharp
public bool ExportPageSetup { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

Each [`Section`](../../../aspose.words/section) in Aspose.Words document model provides page setup information via [`PageSetup`](../../../aspose.words/pagesetup) class. When you export a document to HTML format you might need to keep this information for further usage. In particular, page setup might be important for rendering to paged media (printing) or subsequent conversion to the native Microsoft Word file formats (DOCX, DOC, RTF, WML).

In most cases HTML is intended for viewing in browsers where pagination is not performed. So this feature is inactive by default.
