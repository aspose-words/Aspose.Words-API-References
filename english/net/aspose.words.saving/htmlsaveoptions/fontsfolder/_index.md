## HtmlSaveOptions.FontsFolder property

Specifies the physical folder where fonts are saved when exporting a document to HTML. Default is an empty string.

```csharp
public string FontsFolder { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

When you save a [`Document`](../../../aspose.words/document) in HTML format and [`ExportFontResources`](../exportfontresources) is set to `true`, Aspose.Words needs to save fonts used in the document as standalone files. `FontsFolder` allows you to specify where the fonts will be saved and [`FontsFolderAlias`](../fontsfolderalias) allows to specify how the font URIs will be constructed.

If you save a document into a file and provide a file name, Aspose.Words, by default, saves the fonts in the same folder where the document file is saved. Use `FontsFolder` to override this behavior.

If you save a document into a stream, Aspose.Words does not have a folder where to save the fonts, but still needs to save the fonts somewhere. In this case, you need to specify an accessible folder in the `FontsFolder` property or provide custom streams via the [`FontSavingCallback`](../fontsavingcallback) event handler.

If the folder specified by `FontsFolder` doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

[`ResourceFolder`](../resourcefolder) is another way to specify a folder where fonts should be saved.
