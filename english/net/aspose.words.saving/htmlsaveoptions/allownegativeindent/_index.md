## HtmlSaveOptions.AllowNegativeIndent property

Specifies whether negative left and right indents of paragraphs are normalized when saving to HTML, MHTML or EPUB. Default value is `false`.

```csharp
public bool AllowNegativeIndent { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

When negative indent is not allowed, it is exported as zero margin to HTML. When negative indent is allowed, a paragraph might appear partially outside of the browser window.
