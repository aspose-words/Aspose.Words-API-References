## HtmlSaveOptions.ExportRoundtripInformation property

Specifies whether to write the roundtrip information when saving to HTML, MHTML or EPUB. Default value is `true` for HTML and `false` for MHTML and EPUB.

```csharp
public bool ExportRoundtripInformation { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Saving of the roundtrip information allows to restore document properties such as tab stops, comments, headers and footers during the HTML documents loading back into a [`Document`](../../../aspose.words/document) object.

When `true`, the roundtrip information is exported as -aw-* CSS properties of the corresponding HTML elements.

When `false`, causes no roundtrip information to be output into produced files.
