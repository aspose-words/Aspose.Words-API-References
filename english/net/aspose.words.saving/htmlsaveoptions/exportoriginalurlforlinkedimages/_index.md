## HtmlSaveOptions.ExportOriginalUrlForLinkedImages property

Specifies whether original URL should be used as the URL of the linked images. Default value is `false`.

```csharp
public bool ExportOriginalUrlForLinkedImages { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

If value is set to `true`[`SourceFullName`](../../../aspose.words.drawing/imagedata/sourcefullname) value is used as the URL of linked images and linked images are not loaded into document's folder or [`ImagesFolder`](../imagesfolder).

If value is set to `false` linked images are loaded into document's folder or [`ImagesFolder`](../imagesfolder) and URL of each linked image is constructed depending on document's folder, [`ImagesFolder`](../imagesfolder) and [`ImagesFolderAlias`](../imagesfolderalias) properties.
