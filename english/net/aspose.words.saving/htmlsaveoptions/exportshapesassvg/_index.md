## HtmlSaveOptions.ExportShapesAsSvg property

Controls whether [`Shape`](../../../aspose.words.drawing/shape) nodes are converted to SVG images when saving to HTML, MHTML or EPUB. Default value is `false`.

```csharp
public bool ExportShapesAsSvg { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

If this option is set to `true`, [`Shape`](../../../aspose.words.drawing/shape) nodes are exported as &lt;svg&gt; elements. Otherwise, they are rendered to bitmaps and are exported as &lt;img&gt; elements.

Note that this options also affects text boxes, because they are represented by [`Shape`](../../../aspose.words.drawing/shape) nodes. As a result, if this option is set to `true`, it overrides the [`ExportTextBoxAsSvg`](../exporttextboxassvg) property value and causes text boxes to be converted to SVG.
