## HtmlSaveOptions.ExportTextBoxAsSvg property

Controls whether [`Shape`](../../../aspose.words.drawing/shape) nodes that represent text boxes are converted to SVG images when saving to HTML, MHTML or EPUB. Default value is `false`.

```csharp
public bool ExportTextBoxAsSvg { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

If this option is set to `true`, text boxes are exported as &lt;svg&gt; elements. Otherwise, they are rendered to bitmaps and are exported as &lt;img&gt; elements.

Note that if [`ExportShapesAsSvg`](../exportshapesassvg) is set to `true`, text boxes will be exported as SVG even if this property is set to `false`.
