## HtmlSaveOptions.ExportHeadersFootersMode property

Specifies how headers and footers are output to HTML, MHTML or EPUB. Default value is PerSection for HTML/MHTML and None for EPUB.

```csharp
public ExportHeadersFootersMode ExportHeadersFootersMode { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

It is hard to meaningfully output headers and footers to HTML because HTML is not paginated.

When this property is PerSection, Aspose.Words exports only primary headers and footers at the beginning and the end of each section.

When it is FirstSectionHeaderLastSectionFooter only first primary header and the last primary footer (including linked to previous) are exported.

You can disable export of headers and footers altogether by setting this property to None.
