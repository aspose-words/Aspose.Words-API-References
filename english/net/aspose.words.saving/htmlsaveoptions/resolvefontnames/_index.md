## HtmlSaveOptions.ResolveFontNames property

Specifies whether font family names used in the document are resolved and substituted according to [`FontSettings`](../../../aspose.words/document/fontsettings) when being written into HTML-based formats.

```csharp
public bool ResolveFontNames { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

By default, this option is set to `false` and font family names are written to HTML as specified in source documents. That is, [`FontSettings`](../../../aspose.words/document/fontsettings) are ignored and no resolution or substitution of font family names is performed.

If this option is set to `true`, Aspose.Words uses [`FontSettings`](../../../aspose.words/document/fontsettings) to resolve each font family name specified in a source document into the name of an available font family, performing font substitution as required.
