## HtmlSaveOptions.ResolveFontNames property

Specifies whether font family names used in the document are resolved and substituted according to [`FontSettings`](../../../aspose.words/document/fontsettings) when being written into HTML-based formats.

```csharp
public bool ResolveFontNames { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

By default, this option is set to `false` and font family names are written to HTML as specified in source documents. That is, [`FontSettings`](../../../aspose.words/document/fontsettings) are ignored and no resolution or substitution of font family names is performed.

If this option is set to `true`, Aspose.Words uses [`FontSettings`](../../../aspose.words/document/fontsettings) to resolve each font family name specified in a source document into the name of an available font family, performing font substitution as required.

### Examples

Shows how to resolve all font names before writing them to HTML.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Missing font.docx");

// This document contains text that names a font that we do not have.
Assert.NotNull(doc.FontInfos["28 Days Later"]);

// If we have no way of getting this font, and we want to be able to display all the text
// in this document in an output HTML, we can substitute it with another font.
FontSettings fontSettings = new FontSettings
{
    SubstitutionSettings =
    {
        DefaultFontSubstitution =
        {
            DefaultFontName = "Arial",
            Enabled = true
        }
    }
};

doc.FontSettings = fontSettings;

HtmlSaveOptions saveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Html)
{
    // By default, this option is set to 'False' and Aspose.Words writes font names as specified in the source document
    ResolveFontNames = resolveFontNames
};

doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "HtmlSaveOptions.ResolveFontNames.html", saveOptions);

string outDocContents = File.ReadAllText(ArtifactsDir + "HtmlSaveOptions.ResolveFontNames.html");

Assert.True(resolveFontNames
    ? Regex.Match(outDocContents, "<span style=\"font-family:Arial\">").Success
    : Regex.Match(outDocContents, "<span style=\"font-family:\'28 Days Later\'\">").Success);
```
