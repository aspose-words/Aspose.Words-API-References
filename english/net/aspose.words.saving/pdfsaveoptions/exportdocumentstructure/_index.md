## PdfSaveOptions.ExportDocumentStructure property

Gets or sets a value determining whether or not to export document structure.

```csharp
public bool ExportDocumentStructure { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

This value is ignored when saving to PDF/A-1a, PDF/A-2a and PDF/UA-1 because document structure is required for this compliance.

Note that exporting the document structure significantly increases the memory consumption, especially for the large documents.
