## PdfSaveOptions.JpegQuality property

Gets or sets a value determining the quality of the JPEG images inside PDF document.

```csharp
public int JpegQuality { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

The default value is 100.

This property is used in conjunction with the [`ImageCompression`](../imagecompression) option.

Has effect only when a document contains JPEG images.

Use this property to get or set the quality of the images inside a document when saving in PDF format. The value may vary from 0 to 100 where 0 means worst quality but maximum compression and 100 means best quality but minimum compression. If quality is 100 and source image is JPEG, it means no compression - original bytes will be saved.
