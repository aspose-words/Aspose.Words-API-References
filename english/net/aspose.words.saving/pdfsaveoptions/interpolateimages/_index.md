## PdfSaveOptions.InterpolateImages property

A flag indicating whether image interpolation shall be performed by a conforming reader. When `false` is specified, the flag is not written to the output document and the default behaviour of reader is used instead.

```csharp
public bool InterpolateImages { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

When the resolution of a source image is significantly lower than that of the output device, each source sample covers many device pixels. As a result, images can appear jaggy or blocky. These visual artifacts can be reduced by applying an image interpolation algorithm during rendering. Instead of painting all pixels covered by a source sample with the same color, image interpolation attempts to produce a smooth transition between adjacent sample values.

A conforming Reader may choose to not implement this feature of PDF, or may use any specific implementation of interpolation that it wishes.

The default value is `false`.

Interpolation flag is prohibited by PDF/A compliance. `false` value will be used automatically when saving to PDF/A.
