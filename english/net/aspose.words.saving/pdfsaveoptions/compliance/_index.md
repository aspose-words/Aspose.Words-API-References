## PdfSaveOptions.Compliance property

Specifies the PDF standards compliance level for output documents.

```csharp
public PdfCompliance Compliance { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Default is Pdf17.

### Examples

Shows how to set the PDF standards compliance level of saved PDF documents.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Images.docx");

// Create a "PdfSaveOptions" object that we can pass to the document's "Save" method
// to modify how that method converts the document to .PDF.
PdfSaveOptions saveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions();

// Set the "Compliance" property to "PdfCompliance.PdfA1b" to comply with the "PDF/A-1b" standard,
// which aims to preserve the visual appearance of the document as Aspose.Words convert it to PDF.
// Set the "Compliance" property to "PdfCompliance.Pdf17" to comply with the "1.7" standard.
// Set the "Compliance" property to "PdfCompliance.PdfA1a" to comply with the "PDF/A-1a" standard,
// which complies with "PDF/A-1b" as well as preserving the document structure of the original document.
// This helps with making documents searchable but may significantly increase the size of already large documents.
saveOptions.Compliance = pdfCompliance;

doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "PdfSaveOptions.Compliance.pdf", saveOptions);
```
