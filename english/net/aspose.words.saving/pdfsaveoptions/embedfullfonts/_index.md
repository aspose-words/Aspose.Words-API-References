## PdfSaveOptions.EmbedFullFonts property

Controls how fonts are embedded into the resulting PDF documents.

```csharp
public bool EmbedFullFonts { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

The default value is `false`, which means the fonts are subsetted before embedding. Subsetting is useful if you want to keep the output file size smaller. Subsetting removes all unused glyphs from a font.

When this value is set to `true`, a complete font file is embedded into PDF without subsetting. This will result in larger output files, but can be a useful option when you want to edit the resulting PDF later (e.g. add more text).

Some fonts are large (several megabytes) and embedding them without subsetting will result in large output documents.
