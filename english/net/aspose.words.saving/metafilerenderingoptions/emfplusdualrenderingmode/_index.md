## MetafileRenderingOptions.EmfPlusDualRenderingMode property

Gets or sets a value determining how EMF+ Dual metafiles should be rendered.

```csharp
public EmfPlusDualRenderingMode EmfPlusDualRenderingMode { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

EMF+ Dual metafiles contains both EMF+ and EMF parts. MS Word and GDI+ always renders EMF+ part. Aspose.Words currently doesn't fully supports all EMF+ records and in some cases rendering result of EMF part looks better then rendering result of EMF+ part.

This option is used only when metafile is rendered as vector graphics. When metafile is rendered to bitmap, EMF+ part is always used.

The default value is EmfPlusWithFallback.
