## ImageSavingArgs.IsImageAvailable property

Returns `true` if the current image is available for export.

```csharp
public bool IsImageAvailable { get; }
```

### Remarks

Some images in the document can be unavailable, for example, because the image is linked and the link is inaccessible or does not point to a valid image. In this case Aspose.Words exports an icon with a red cross. This property returns `true` if the original image is available; returns `false` if the original image is not available and a "no image" icon will be offered for save.

When saving a group shape or a shape that doesn't require any image this property is always `true`.
