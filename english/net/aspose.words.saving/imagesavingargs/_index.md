## ImageSavingArgs class

Provides data for the [`ImageSaving`](../iimagesavingcallback/imagesaving) event.

```csharp
public class ImageSavingArgs
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [CurrentShape](currentshape) { get; } | Gets the [`ShapeBase`](../../aspose.words.drawing/shapebase) object corresponding to the shape or group shape that is about to be saved. |
| [Document](document) { get; } | Gets the document object that is currently being saved. |
| [ImageFileName](imagefilename) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the file name (without path) where the image will be saved to. |
| [ImageStream](imagestream) { get; set; } | Allows to specify the stream where the image will be saved to. |
| [IsImageAvailable](isimageavailable) { get; } | Returns `true` if the current image is available for export. |
| [KeepImageStreamOpen](keepimagestreamopen) { get; set; } | Specifies whether Aspose.Words should keep the stream open or close it after saving an image. |

## Remarks

By default, when Aspose.Words saves a document to HTML, it saves each image into a separate file. Aspose.Words uses the document file name and a unique number to generate unique file name for each image found in the document.

[`ImageSavingArgs`](../imagesavingargs) allows to redefine how image file names are generated or to completely circumvent saving of images into files by providing your own stream objects.

To apply your own logic for generating image file names use the [`ImageFileName`](./imagefilename), [`CurrentShape`](./currentshape) and [`IsImageAvailable`](./isimageavailable) properties.

To save images into streams instead of files, use the [`ImageStream`](./imagestream) property.
