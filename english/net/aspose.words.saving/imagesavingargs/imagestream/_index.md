## ImageSavingArgs.ImageStream property

Allows to specify the stream where the image will be saved to.

```csharp
public Stream ImageStream { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

This property allows you to save images to streams instead of files during HTML.

The default value is `null`. When this property is `null`, the image will be saved to a file specified in the [`ImageFileName`](../imagefilename) property.

Using [`IImageSavingCallback`](../../iimagesavingcallback) you cannot substitute one image with another. It is intended only for control over location where to save images.
