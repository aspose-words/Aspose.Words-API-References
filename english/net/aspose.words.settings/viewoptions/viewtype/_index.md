## ViewOptions.ViewType property

Controls the view mode in Microsoft Word.

```csharp
public ViewType ViewType { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Although Aspose.Words is able to read and write this option, its usage is application-specific. For example MS Word 2013 does not respect the value of this option.
