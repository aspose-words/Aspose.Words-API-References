Represents information about a single record within an external data source that is to be excluded from the mail merge.

```csharp
public class OdsoRecipientData
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [OdsoRecipientData](odsorecipientdata)() | The default constructor. |
| [Active](active) { get; set; } | Specifies whether the record from the data source shall be imported into a document when the mail merge is performed. The default value is `true`. |
| [Column](column) { get; set; } | Specifies the column within the data source that contains unique data for the current record. The default value is 0. |
| [Hash](hash) { get; set; } | Represents the hash code for this record. Sometimes Microsoft Word uses [`Hash`](./hash) of a whole record instead of a [`UniqueTag`](./uniquetag) value. The default value is 0. |
| [UniqueTag](uniquetag) { get; set; } | Specifies the contents of a given record in the column containing unique data. The default value is `null`. |
| [Clone](clone)() | Returns a deep clone of this object. |

## Remarks

If a record shall be merged into a merged document, then no information is needed about that record. However, if a given record shall not be merged into a merged document, then the value of the unique key for that record shall be stored in the [`UniqueTag`](./uniquetag) property of this object to indicate this exclusion.
