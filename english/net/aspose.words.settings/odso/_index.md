| [Odso](odso)() | The default constructor. |
| [ColumnDelimiter](columndelimiter) { get; set; } | Specifies the character which shall be interpreted as the column delimiter used to separate columns within external data sources. The default value is 0 which means there is no column delimiter defined. |
| [DataSource](datasource) { get; set; } | Specifies the location of the external data source to be connected to a document to perform the mail merge. The default value is an empty string. |
| [DataSourceType](datasourcetype) { get; set; } | Specifies the type of the external data source to be connected to as part of the ODSO connection information for this mail merge. The default value is Default. |
| [FieldMapDatas](fieldmapdatas) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a collection of objects that specify how columns from the external data source are mapped to the predefined merge field names in the document. This object is never null. |
| [FirstRowContainsColumnNames](firstrowcontainscolumnnames) { get; set; } | Specifies that a hosting application shall treat the first row of data in the specified external data source as a header row containing the names of each column in the data source. The default value is `false`. |

## Remarks

ODSO seems to be the "new" way the newer Microsoft Word versions prefer to use when specifying certain types of data sources for a mail merge document. ODSO probably first appeared in Microsoft Word 2000.

The use of ODSO is poorly documented and the best way to learn how to use the properties of this object is to create a document with a desired data source manually in Microsoft Word and then open that document using Aspose.Words and examine the properties of the [`MailMergeSettings`](../../aspose.words/document/mailmergesettings) and [`Odso`](../mailmergesettings/odso) objects. This is a good approach to take if you want to learn how to programmatically configure a data source, for example.

You do not normally need to create objects of this class directly because ODSO settings are always available via the [`Odso`](../mailmergesettings/odso) property.
