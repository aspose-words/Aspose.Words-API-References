## Odso.ColumnDelimiter property

Specifies the character which shall be interpreted as the column delimiter used to separate columns within external data sources. The default value is 0 which means there is no column delimiter defined.

```csharp
public char ColumnDelimiter { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

RK I have never seen this in use.
