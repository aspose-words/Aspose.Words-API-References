## CompatibilityOptions.OptimizeFor method

Allows to optimize the document contents as well as default Aspose.Words behavior to a particular versions of MS Word.

Use this method to prevent MS Word from displaying "Compatibility mode" ribbon upon document loading. (Note that you may also need to set the [`Compliance`](../../../aspose.words.saving/ooxmlsaveoptions/compliance) property to Iso29500_2008_Transitional or higher.)

```csharp
public void OptimizeFor(MsWordVersion version)
```
