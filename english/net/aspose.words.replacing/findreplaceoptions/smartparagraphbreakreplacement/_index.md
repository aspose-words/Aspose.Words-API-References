## FindReplaceOptions.SmartParagraphBreakReplacement property

Gets or sets a boolean value indicating either it is allowed to replace paragraph break when there is no next sibling paragraph.

The default value is `false`.

```csharp
public bool SmartParagraphBreakReplacement { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

This option allows to replace paragraph break when there is no next sibling paragraph to which all child nodes can be moved, by finding any (not necessarily sibling) next paragraph after the paragraph being replaced.
