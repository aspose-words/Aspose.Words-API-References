## FindReplaceOptions.LegacyMode property

Gets or sets a boolean value indicating that old find/replace algorithm is used.

```csharp
public bool LegacyMode { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

Use this flag if you need exactly the same behavior as before advanced find/replace feature was introduced. Note that old algorithm does not support advanced features such as replace with breaks, apply formatting and so on.
