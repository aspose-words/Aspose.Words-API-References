### Remarks

**CertificateHolder** can be created by static factory methods only. It contains an instance of **X509Certificate2** which is used to introduce private, public keys and certificate chains into the system. This class is applied in [`DigitalSignatureUtil`](../digitalsignatureutil) and [`PdfDigitalSignatureDetails`](../../aspose.words.saving/pdfdigitalsignaturedetails) instead of obsolete methods with X509Certificate2 as parameters.
