## CertificateHolder class

Represents a holder of X509Certificate2 instance.

```csharp
public class CertificateHolder
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| static [Create](create)(…) | Creates CertificateHolder object using byte array of PKCS12 store and its password. (4 methods) |
| [Certificate](certificate) { get; } | Returns the instance of X509Certificate2 which holds private, public keys and certificate chain. |

## Remarks

CertificateHolder can be created by static factory methods only. It contains an instance of X509Certificate2 which is used to introduce private, public keys and certificate chains into the system. This class is applied in [`DigitalSignatureUtil`](../digitalsignatureutil) and [`PdfDigitalSignatureDetails`](../../aspose.words.saving/pdfdigitalsignaturedetails) instead of obsolete methods with X509Certificate2 as parameters.
