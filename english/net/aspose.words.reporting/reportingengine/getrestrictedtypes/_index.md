## ReportingEngine.GetRestrictedTypes method

Returns types, which members as well as which derived types' members should be inaccessible by the engine through template syntax.

public static Type[] GetRestrictedTypes()
```

### Return Value

Types, which members as well as which derived types' members should be inaccessible by the engine through template syntax.

The returned array contains items previously set using [`SetRestrictedTypes`](../setrestrictedtypes/).

Changing items of the returned array has no effect on restricted types. To change restricted types, use [`SetRestrictedTypes`](../setrestrictedtypes/) instead.
