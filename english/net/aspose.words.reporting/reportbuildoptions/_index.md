## ReportBuildOptions enumeration

Specifies options controlling behavior of [`ReportingEngine`](../reportingengine) while building a report.

```csharp
[Flags]
public enum ReportBuildOptions
```

## Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | `0x0` | Specifies default options. |
| AllowMissingMembers | `0x1` | Specifies that missing object members should be treated as null literals by the engine. This option affects only access to instance (that is, non-static) object members and extension methods. If this option is not set, the engine throws an exception when encounters a missing object member. |
| RemoveEmptyParagraphs | `0x2` | Specifies that the engine should remove paragraphs becoming empty after template syntax tags are removed or replaced with empty values. |
| InlineErrorMessages | `0x4` | Specifies that the engine should inline template syntax error messages into output documents. If this option is not set, the engine throws an exception when encounters a syntax error. |
| UseLegacyHeaderFooterVisiting | `0x8` | Specifies that the engine should visit section child nodes (headers, footers, bodies) in an order compatible with Aspose.Words versions prior 21.9. |
