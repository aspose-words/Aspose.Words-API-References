## CustomXmlPart.Id property

Gets or sets the string that identifies this custom XML part within an OOXML document.

```csharp
public string Id { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

ISO/IEC 29500 specifies that this value is a GUID, but old versions of Microsoft Word allowed any string here. Aspose.Words does the same for ECMA-376 format. But note, that Microsoft Word Online fails to open a document created with a non-GUID value. So, a GUID is preferred value for this property.

A valid value must be an identifier that is unique among all custom XML data parts in this document.

The default value is an empty string. The value cannot be `null`.
