## CustomPart.RelationshipType property

Gets or sets the relationship type from the parent part to this custom part.

```csharp
public string RelationshipType { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

The relationship type for a custom part must be "unknown" e.g. a custom relationship type, not one of the relationship types defined within ISO/IEC 29500.

The default value is an empty string. A valid value must be a non-empty string.
