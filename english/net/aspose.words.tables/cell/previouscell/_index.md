## Cell.PreviousCell property

Gets the previous [`Cell`](../) node.

```csharp
public Cell PreviousCell { get; }
```

## Remarks

The method can be used when you need to have typed access to cells of a [`Row`](../../row/). If a [`StructuredDocumentTag`](../../../aspose.words.markup/structureddocumenttag/) node is found in a row instead of a cell, it is automatically traversed to get a cell contained within.
