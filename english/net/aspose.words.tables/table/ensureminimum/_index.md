## Table.EnsureMinimum method

If the table has no rows, creates and appends one [`Row`](../../row/).

```csharp
public void EnsureMinimum()
```

## Examples

Shows how to ensure that a table node contains the nodes we need to add content.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
Table table = new Table(doc);
doc.FirstSection.Body.AppendChild(table);

// Tables contain rows, which contain cells, which may contain paragraphs
// with typical elements such as runs, shapes, and even other tables.
// Our new table has none of these nodes, and we cannot add contents to it until it does.
Assert.AreEqual(0, table.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Any, true).Count);

// Calling the "EnsureMinimum" method on a table will ensure that
// the table has at least one row and one cell with an empty paragraph.
table.EnsureMinimum();
table.FirstRow.FirstCell.FirstParagraph.AppendChild(new Run(doc, "Hello world!"));
```
