## Table.ConvertToHorizontallyMergedCells method

Converts cells horizontally merged by width to cells merged by [`HorizontalMerge`](../../cellformat/horizontalmerge).

```csharp
public void ConvertToHorizontallyMergedCells()
```

## Remarks

Table cells can be horizontally merged either using merge flags [`HorizontalMerge`](../../cellformat/horizontalmerge) or using cell width [`Width`](../../cellformat/width).When table cell is merged by width property [`HorizontalMerge`](../../cellformat/horizontalmerge) is meaningless but sometimes having merge flags is more convenient way.Use this method to transforms table cells horizontally merged by width to cells merged by merge flags.
