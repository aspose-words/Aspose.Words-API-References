## Table.ConvertToHorizontallyMergedCells method

Converts cells horizontally merged by width to cells merged by [`HorizontalMerge`](../../cellformat/horizontalmerge).

```csharp
public void ConvertToHorizontallyMergedCells()
```

### Remarks

Table cells can be horizontally merged either using merge flags [`HorizontalMerge`](../../cellformat/horizontalmerge) or using cell width [`Width`](../../cellformat/width).

When table cell is merged by width property [`HorizontalMerge`](../../cellformat/horizontalmerge) is meaningless but sometimes having merge flags is more convenient way.

Use this method to transforms table cells horizontally merged by width to cells merged by merge flags.

### Examples

Shows how to convert cells horizontally merged by width to cells merged by CellFormat.HorizontalMerge.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Table with merged cells.docx");

// Microsoft Word does not write merge flags anymore, defining merged cells by width instead.
// Aspose.Words by default define only 5 cells in a row, and none of them have the horizontal merge flag,
// even though there were 7 cells in the row before the horizontal merging took place.
Table table = doc.FirstSection.Body.Tables[0];
Row row = table.Rows[0];

Assert.AreEqual(5, row.Cells.Count);
Assert.True(row.Cells.All(c => ((Cell)c).CellFormat.HorizontalMerge == CellMerge.None));

// Use the "ConvertToHorizontallyMergedCells" method to convert cells horizontally merged
// by its width to the cell horizontally merged by flags.
// Now, we have 7 cells, and some of them have horizontal merge values.
table.ConvertToHorizontallyMergedCells();
row = table.Rows[0];

Assert.AreEqual(7, row.Cells.Count);

Assert.AreEqual(CellMerge.None, row.Cells[0].CellFormat.HorizontalMerge);
Assert.AreEqual(CellMerge.First, row.Cells[1].CellFormat.HorizontalMerge);
Assert.AreEqual(CellMerge.Previous, row.Cells[2].CellFormat.HorizontalMerge);
Assert.AreEqual(CellMerge.None, row.Cells[3].CellFormat.HorizontalMerge);
Assert.AreEqual(CellMerge.First, row.Cells[4].CellFormat.HorizontalMerge);
Assert.AreEqual(CellMerge.Previous, row.Cells[5].CellFormat.HorizontalMerge);
Assert.AreEqual(CellMerge.None, row.Cells[6].CellFormat.HorizontalMerge);
```
