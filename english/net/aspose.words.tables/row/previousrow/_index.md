## Row.PreviousRow property

Gets the previous [`Row`](../) node.

```csharp
public Row PreviousRow { get; }
```

## Remarks

The method can be used when you need to have typed access to table rows. If a [`StructuredDocumentTag`](../../../aspose.words.markup/structureddocumenttag/) node is found in a table instead of a row, it is automatically traversed to get a row contained within.
