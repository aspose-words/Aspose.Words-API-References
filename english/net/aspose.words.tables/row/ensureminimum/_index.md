## Row.EnsureMinimum method

If the Row has no cells, creates and appends one Cell.

```csharp
public void EnsureMinimum()
```

### Examples

Shows how to ensure a row node contains the nodes we need to begin adding content to it.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
Table table = new Table(doc);
doc.FirstSection.Body.AppendChild(table);
Row row = new Row(doc);
table.AppendChild(row);

// Rows contain cells, containing paragraphs with typical elements such as runs, shapes, and even other tables.
// Our new row has none of these nodes, and we cannot add contents to it until it does.
Assert.AreEqual(0, row.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Any, true).Count);

// Calling the "EnsureMinimum" method on a table will ensure that
// the table has at least one cell with an empty paragraph.
row.EnsureMinimum();
row.FirstCell.FirstParagraph.AppendChild(new Run(doc, "Hello world!"));
```
