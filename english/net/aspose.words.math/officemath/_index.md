### Remarks

In this version of Aspose.Words, [`OfficeMath`](../officemath) nodes do not provide public methods and properties to create or modify a OfficeMath object. In this version you are not able to instantiate Math nodes or modify existing except deleting them.

[`OfficeMath`](../officemath) can only be a child of [`Paragraph`](../../aspose.words/paragraph).
