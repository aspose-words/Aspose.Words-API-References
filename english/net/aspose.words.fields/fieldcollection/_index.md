## FieldCollection class

A collection of [`Field`](../field) objects that represents the fields in the specified range.

```csharp
public class FieldCollection : IEnumerable<Field>
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Count](count) { get; } | Returns the number of the fields in the collection. |
| [Item](item) { get; } | Returns a field at the specified index. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Clear](clear)() | Removes all fields of this collection from the document and from this collection itself. |
| [GetEnumerator](getenumerator)() | Returns an enumerator object. |
| [Remove](remove)(Field) | Removes the specified field from this collection and from the document. |
| [RemoveAt](removeat)(int) | Removes a field at the specified index from this collection and from the document. |

### Remarks

An instance of this collection iterates fields which start fall within the specified range.

The [`FieldCollection`](../fieldcollection) collection does not own the fields it contains, rather, is just a selection of fields.

The [`FieldCollection`](../fieldcollection) collection is "live", i.e. changes to the children of the node object that it was created from are immediately reflected in the fields returned by the [`FieldCollection`](../fieldcollection) properties and methods.
