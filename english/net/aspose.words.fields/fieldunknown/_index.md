```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

// Insert a field that does not denote an objective field type in its field code.
Field field = builder.InsertField(" NOTAREALFIELD //a");

// The "FieldNone" field type is reserved for fields such as these.
