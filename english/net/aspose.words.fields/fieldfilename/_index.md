```

| [IncludeFullPath](includefullpath) { get; set; } | Gets or sets whether to include the full file path name. |

## Remarks

Retrieves the name of the current document from its storage location.In the current implementation, uses the [`OriginalFileName`](../../aspose.words/document/originalfilename) property to retrieve the file name. If the document was loaded from a stream or created blank, uses the name of the file that is being saved to (if known).
