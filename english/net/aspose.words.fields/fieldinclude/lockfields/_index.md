```

### Examples

Shows how to create an INCLUDE field, and set its properties.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

// We can use an INCLUDE field to import a portion of another document in the local file system.
// The bookmark from the other document that we reference with this field contains this imported portion.
FieldInclude field = (FieldInclude)builder.InsertField(FieldType.FieldInclude, true);
field.SourceFullName = MyDir + "Bookmarks.docx";
field.BookmarkName = "MyBookmark1";
field.LockFields = false;
field.TextConverter = "Microsoft Word";

Assert.True(Regex.Match(field.GetFieldCode(), " INCLUDE .* MyBookmark1 \\\\c \"Microsoft Word\"").Success);

doc.UpdateFields();
doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "Field.INCLUDE.docx");
```
