## FieldStart class

Represents a start of a Word field in a document.

```csharp
public class FieldStart : FieldChar
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [FieldData](fielddata) { get; } | Gets custom field data which is associated with the field. |
| override [NodeType](nodetype) { get; } | Returns FieldStart. |
| override [Accept](accept)(…) | Accepts a visitor. |

## Remarks

[`FieldStart`](../fieldstart) is an inline-level node and represented by the [`FieldStartChar`](../../aspose.words/controlchar/fieldstartchar) control character in the document.[`FieldStart`](../fieldstart) can only be a child of [`Paragraph`](../../aspose.words/paragraph).A complete field in a Microsoft Word document is a complex structure consisting of a field start character, field code, field separator character, field result and field end character. Some fields only have field start, field code and field end.To easily insert a new field into a document, use the [`InsertField`](../../aspose.words/documentbuilder/insertfield) method.
