## FieldEditTime class

Implements the EDITTIME field.

```csharp
public class FieldEditTime : Field
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [FieldEditTime](fieldedittime)() | The default constructor. |

### Remarks

Retrieves the total editing time, in minutes, since the document was created.

### Examples

Shows how to use the EDITTIME field.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

// The EDITTIME field will show, in minutes,
// the time spent with the document open in a Microsoft Word window.
builder.MoveToHeaderFooter(HeaderFooterType.HeaderPrimary);
builder.Write("You've been editing this document for ");
FieldEditTime field = (FieldEditTime)builder.InsertField(FieldType.FieldEditTime, true);
builder.Writeln(" minutes.");

// This built in document property tracks the minutes. Microsoft Word uses this property
// to track the time spent with the document open. We can also edit it ourselves.
doc.BuiltInDocumentProperties.TotalEditingTime = 10;
field.Update();

Assert.AreEqual(" EDITTIME ", field.GetFieldCode());
Assert.AreEqual("10", field.Result);

// The field does not update itself in real-time, and will also have to be
// manually updated in Microsoft Word anytime we need an accurate value.
doc.UpdateFields();
doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "Field.EDITTIME.docx");
```
