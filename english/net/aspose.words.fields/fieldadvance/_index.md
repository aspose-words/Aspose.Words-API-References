## Public Members

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [FieldAdvance](fieldadvance)() | The default constructor. |
| [DownOffset](downoffset) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the number of points by which the text that follows the field should be moved down. |
| [HorizontalPosition](horizontalposition) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the number of points by which the text that follows the field should be moved horizontally from the left edge of the column, frame, or text box. |
| [LeftOffset](leftoffset) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the number of points by which the text that follows the field should be moved left. |
| [RightOffset](rightoffset) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the number of points by which the text that follows the field should be moved right. |
| [UpOffset](upoffset) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the number of points by which the text that follows the field should be moved up. |
| [VerticalPosition](verticalposition) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the number of points by which the text that follows the field should be moved vertically from the top edge of the page. |

### Remarks

Moves the starting point at which the text that lexically follows the field is displayed to the right or left, up or down, or to a specific horizontal or vertical position.

### Examples

Shows how to insert an ADVANCE field, and edit its properties.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

builder.Write("This text is in its normal place.");

// Below are two ways of using the ADVANCE field to adjust the position of text that follows it.
// The effects of an ADVANCE field continue to be applied until the paragraph ends,
// or another ADVANCE field updates the offset/coordinate values.
// 1 -  Specify a directional offset:
FieldAdvance field = (FieldAdvance)builder.InsertField(FieldType.FieldAdvance, true);
field.RightOffset = "5";
field.UpOffset = "5";

Assert.AreEqual(" ADVANCE  \\r 5 \\u 5", field.GetFieldCode());

builder.Write("This text will be moved up and to the right.");

field = (FieldAdvance)builder.InsertField(FieldType.FieldAdvance, true);
field.DownOffset = "5";
field.LeftOffset = "100";

Assert.AreEqual(" ADVANCE  \\d 5 \\l 100", field.GetFieldCode());

builder.Writeln("This text is moved down and to the left, overlapping the previous text.");

// 2 -  Move text to a position specified by coordinates:
field = (FieldAdvance)builder.InsertField(FieldType.FieldAdvance, true);
field.HorizontalPosition = "-100";
field.VerticalPosition = "200";

Assert.AreEqual(" ADVANCE  \\x -100 \\y 200", field.GetFieldCode());

builder.Write("This text is in a custom position.");

doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "Field.ADVANCE.docx");
```
