## IFieldUserPromptRespondent interface

Represents the respondent to user prompts during field update.

```csharp
public interface IFieldUserPromptRespondent
```

## Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [Respond](respond)(…) | When implemented, returns a response from the user on prompting. Your implementation should return null to indicate that the user has not responded to the prompt (i.e. the user has pressed the Cancel button in the prompt window). |

## Remarks

The ASK and FILLIN fields are the examples of fields that prompt the user for some response. Implement this interface and assign it to the [`UserPromptRespondent`](../fieldoptions/userpromptrespondent) property to establish interaction between field update and the user.
