## FieldNextIf class

Implements the NEXTIF field.

```csharp
public class FieldNextIf : Field
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [FieldNextIf](fieldnextif)() | The default constructor. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ComparisonOperator](comparisonoperator) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the comparison operator. |
| [LeftExpression](leftexpression) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the left part of the comparison expression. |
| [RightExpression](rightexpression) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the right part of the comparison expression. |

### Remarks

Compares the values designated by the expressions [`LeftExpression`](./leftexpression) and [`RightExpression`](./rightexpression) in comparison using the operator designated by [`ComparisonOperator`](./comparisonoperator). If the comparison is true, the next data record is merged into the current merge document. (Merge fields that follow the NEXTIF in the main document are replaced by values from the next data record rather than the current data record.) If the comparison is false, the next data record is merged into a new merge document.
