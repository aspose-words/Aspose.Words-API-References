{
    Document doc = new Document();
    DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

    // By default, time is displayed in the "h:mm am/pm" format.
    FieldTime field = InsertFieldTime(builder, "");

    Assert.AreEqual(" TIME ", field.GetFieldCode());

    // We can use the \@ flag to change the format of our displayed time.
    field = InsertFieldTime(builder, "\\@ HHmm");

    Assert.AreEqual(" TIME \\@ HHmm", field.GetFieldCode());

    // We can adjust the format to get TIME field to also display the date, according to the Gregorian calendar.
    field = InsertFieldTime(builder, "\\@ \"M/d/yyyy h mm:ss am/pm\"");

    Assert.AreEqual(" TIME \\@ \"M/d/yyyy h mm:ss am/pm\"", field.GetFieldCode());

    doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "Field.TIME.docx");

/// <summary>
/// Use a document builder to insert a TIME field, insert a new paragraph and return the field.
/// </summary>
private static FieldTime InsertFieldTime(DocumentBuilder builder, string format)
{
    FieldTime field = (FieldTime)builder.InsertField(FieldType.FieldTime, true);
    builder.MoveTo(field.Separator);
    builder.Write(format);
    builder.MoveTo(field.Start.ParentNode);

    builder.InsertParagraph();
    return field;
