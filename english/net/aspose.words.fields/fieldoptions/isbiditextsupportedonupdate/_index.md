## FieldOptions.IsBidiTextSupportedOnUpdate property

Gets or sets the value indicating whether bidirectional text is fully supported during field update or not.

```csharp
public bool IsBidiTextSupportedOnUpdate { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

When this property is set to true, additional steps are performed to produce Right-To-Left language (i.e. Arabic or Hebrew) compatible field result during its update.

When this property is set to false and Right-To-Left language is used, correctness of field result after its update is not guaranteed.

The default value is false.
