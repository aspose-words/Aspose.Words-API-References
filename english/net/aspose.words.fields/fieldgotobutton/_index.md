FieldGoToButton field = (FieldGoToButton)builder.InsertField(FieldType.FieldGoToButton, true);
field.DisplayText = "My Button";
field.Location = "MyBookmark";

Assert.AreEqual(" GOTOBUTTON  MyBookmark My Button", field.GetFieldCode());

// Insert a valid bookmark for the field to reference.
builder.InsertBreak(BreakType.PageBreak);
builder.StartBookmark(field.Location);
builder.Writeln("Bookmark text contents.");
builder.EndBookmark(field.Location);
