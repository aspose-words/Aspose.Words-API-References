## FieldChar class

Base class for nodes that represent field characters in a document.

```csharp
public abstract class FieldChar : SpecialChar
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [FieldType](fieldtype) { get; } | Returns the type of the field. |
| [IsDirty](isdirty) { get; set; } | Gets or sets whether the current result of the field is no longer correct (stale) due to other modifications made to the document. |
| [IsLocked](islocked) { get; set; } | Gets or sets whether the parent field is locked (should not recalculate its result). |
| [GetField](getfield)() | Returns a field for the field char. |

## Remarks

A complete field in a Microsoft Word document is a complex structure consisting of a field start character, field code, field separator character, field result and field end character. Some fields only have field start, field code and field end.To easily insert a new field into a document, use the [`InsertField`](../../aspose.words/documentbuilder/insertfield) method.
