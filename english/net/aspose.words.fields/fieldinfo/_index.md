## Examples

Shows how to work with INFO fields.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

// Set a value for the "Comments" built-in property and then insert an INFO field to display that property's value.
doc.BuiltInDocumentProperties.Comments = "My comment";
FieldInfo field = (FieldInfo)builder.InsertField(FieldType.FieldInfo, true);
field.InfoType = "Comments";
field.Update();

Assert.AreEqual(" INFO  Comments", field.GetFieldCode());
Assert.AreEqual("My comment", field.Result);

builder.Writeln();

// Setting a value for the field's NewValue property and updating
// the field will also overwrite the corresponding built-in property with the new value.
field = (FieldInfo)builder.InsertField(FieldType.FieldInfo, true);
field.InfoType = "Comments";
field.NewValue = "New comment";
field.Update();

Assert.AreEqual(" INFO  Comments \"New comment\"", field.GetFieldCode());
Assert.AreEqual("New comment", field.Result);
Assert.AreEqual("New comment", doc.BuiltInDocumentProperties.Comments);

doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "Field.INFO.docx");
```
