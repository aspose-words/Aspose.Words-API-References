### Remarks

Compares the values designated by the expressions [`LeftExpression`](./leftexpression) and [`RightExpression`](./rightexpression) in comparison using the operator designated by [`ComparisonOperator`](./comparisonoperator). If the comparison is true, SKIPIF cancels the current merge document, moves to the next data record in the data source, and starts a new merge document. If the comparison is false, the current merge document is continued.
