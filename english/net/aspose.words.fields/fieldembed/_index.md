### Examples

Shows how some older Microsoft Word fields such as SHAPE and EMBED are handled during loading.

```csharp
// Open a document that was created in Microsoft Word 2003.
Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Legacy fields.doc");

// If we open the Word document and press Alt+F9, we will see a SHAPE and an EMBED field.
// A SHAPE field is the anchor/canvas for an AutoShape object with the "In line with text" wrapping style enabled.
// An EMBED field has the same function, but for an embedded object,
// such as a spreadsheet from an external Excel document.
// However, these fields will not appear in the document's Fields collection.
Assert.AreEqual(0, doc.Range.Fields.Count);

// These fields are supported only by old versions of Microsoft Word.
// The document loading process will convert these fields into Shape objects,
// which we can access in the document's node collection.
NodeCollection shapes = doc.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Shape, true);
Assert.AreEqual(3, shapes.Count);

// The first Shape node corresponds to the SHAPE field in the input document,
// which is the inline canvas for the AutoShape.
Shape shape = (Shape)shapes[0];
Assert.AreEqual(ShapeType.Image, shape.ShapeType);

// The second Shape node is the AutoShape itself.
shape = (Shape)shapes[1];
Assert.AreEqual(ShapeType.Can, shape.ShapeType);

// The third Shape is what was the EMBED field that contained the external spreadsheet.
shape = (Shape)shapes[2];
Assert.AreEqual(ShapeType.OleObject, shape.ShapeType);
```
