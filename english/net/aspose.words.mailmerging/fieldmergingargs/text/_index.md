## FieldMergingArgs.Text property

Gets or sets the text that will be inserted into the document for the current merge field.

```csharp
public string Text { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

When your event handler is called, this property is set to null.If you leave Text as null, the mail merge engine will insert [`FieldValue`](../../fieldmergingargsbase/fieldvalue) in place of the merge field.If you set Text to any string (including empty), the string will be inserted into the document in place of the merge field.
