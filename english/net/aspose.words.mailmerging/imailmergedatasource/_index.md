## IMailMergeDataSource interface

Implement this interface to allow mail merge from a custom data source, such as a list of objects. Master-detail data is also supported.

```csharp
public interface IMailMergeDataSource
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [TableName](../../aspose.words.mailmerging/imailmergedatasource/tablename) { get; } | Returns the name of the data source. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [GetChildDataSource](../../aspose.words.mailmerging/imailmergedatasource/getchilddatasource)(string) | The Aspose.Words mail merge engine invokes this method when it encounters a beginning of a nested mail merge region. |
| [GetValue](../../aspose.words.mailmerging/imailmergedatasource/getvalue)(string, out object) | Returns a value for the specified field name or false if the field is not found. |
| [MoveNext](../../aspose.words.mailmerging/imailmergedatasource/movenext)() | Advances to the next record in the data source. |

### Remarks

When a data source is created, it should be initialized to point to BOF (before the first record). The Aspose.Words mail merge engine will invoke [`MoveNext`](./movenext) to advance to next record and then invoke [`GetValue`](./getvalue) for every merge field it encounters in the document or the current mail merge region.
