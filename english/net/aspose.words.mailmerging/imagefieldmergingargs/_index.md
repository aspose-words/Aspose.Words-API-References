### Remarks

This event occurs during mail merge when an image mail merge field is encountered in the document. You can respond to this event to return a file name, stream, or an Image object to the mail merge engine so it is inserted into the document.

There are three properties available [`ImageFileName`](./imagefilename), [`ImageStream`](./imagestream) and [`Image`](./image) to specify where the image must be taken from. Set only one of these properties.

To insert an image mail merge field into a document in Word, select Insert/Field command, then select MergeField and type Image:MyFieldName.
