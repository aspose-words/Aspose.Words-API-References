## ImageFieldMergingArgs.ImageWidth property

Specifies the image width for the image to insert into the document.

```csharp
public MergeFieldImageDimension ImageWidth { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

The value of this property initially comes from the corresponding MERGEFIELD's code, contained in the template document. To override the initial value, you should assign an instance of [`MergeFieldImageDimension`](../../../aspose.words.fields/mergefieldimagedimension) class to this property or set the properties for the instance of [`MergeFieldImageDimension`](../../../aspose.words.fields/mergefieldimagedimension) class, returned by this property.

To indicate that the original value of the image width should be applied, you should assign the null value to this property or set the [`Value`](../../../aspose.words.fields/mergefieldimagedimension/value) property for the instance of [`MergeFieldImageDimension`](../../../aspose.words.fields/mergefieldimagedimension) class, returned by this property, to a negative value.
