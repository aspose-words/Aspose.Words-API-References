## CompositeNode.GetChildNodes method

Returns a live collection of child nodes that match the specified type.

```csharp
public NodeCollection GetChildNodes(NodeType nodeType, bool isDeep)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| nodeType | NodeType | Specifies the type of nodes to select. |
| isDeep | Boolean | `true` to select from all child nodes recursively; `false` to select only among immediate children. |

### Return Value

A live collection of child nodes of the specified type.

## Remarks

The collection of nodes returned by this method is always live.

A live collection is always in sync with the document. For example, if you selected all sections in a document and enumerate through the collection deleting the sections, the section is removed from the collection immediately when it is removed from the document.

## Examples

Shows how to print all of a document's comments and their replies.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Comments.docx");

NodeCollection comments = doc.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Comment, true);
// If a comment has no ancestor, it is a "top-level" comment as opposed to a reply-type comment.
// Print all top-level comments along with any replies they may have.
foreach (Comment comment in comments.OfType<Comment>().Where(c => c.Ancestor == null))
{
    Console.WriteLine("Top-level comment:");
    Console.WriteLine($"\t\"{comment.GetText().Trim()}\", by {comment.Author}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Has {comment.Replies.Count} replies");
    foreach (Comment commentReply in comment.Replies)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"\t\"{commentReply.GetText().Trim()}\", by {commentReply.Author}");
    }
    Console.WriteLine();
}
```

Shows how to extract images from a document, and save them to the local file system as individual files.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Images.docx");

// Get the collection of shapes from the document,
// and save the image data of every shape with an image as a file to the local file system.
NodeCollection shapes = doc.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Shape, true);

Assert.AreEqual(9, shapes.Count(s => ((Shape)s).HasImage));

int imageIndex = 0;
foreach (Shape shape in shapes.OfType<Shape>())
{
    if (shape.HasImage)
    {
        // The image data of shapes may contain images of many possible image formats. 
        // We can determine a file extension for each image automatically, based on its format.
        string imageFileName =
            $"File.ExtractImages.{imageIndex}{FileFormatUtil.ImageTypeToExtension(shape.ImageData.ImageType)}";
        shape.ImageData.Save(ArtifactsDir + imageFileName);
        imageIndex++;
    }
}
```

Shows how to traverse through a composite node's collection of child nodes.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();

// Add two runs and one shape as child nodes to the first paragraph of this document.
Paragraph paragraph = (Paragraph)doc.GetChild(NodeType.Paragraph, 0, true);
paragraph.AppendChild(new Run(doc, "Hello world! "));

Shape shape = new Shape(doc, ShapeType.Rectangle);
shape.Width = 200;
shape.Height = 200;
// Note that the 'CustomNodeId' is not saved to an output file and exists only during the node lifetime.
shape.CustomNodeId = 100;
shape.WrapType = WrapType.Inline;
paragraph.AppendChild(shape);

paragraph.AppendChild(new Run(doc, "Hello again!"));

// Iterate through the paragraph's collection of immediate children,
// and print any runs or shapes that we find within.
NodeCollection children = paragraph.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Any, false);

Assert.AreEqual(3, paragraph.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Any, false).Count);

foreach (Node child in children)
    switch (child.NodeType)
    {
        case NodeType.Run:
            Console.WriteLine("Run contents:");
            Console.WriteLine($"\t\"{child.GetText().Trim()}\"");
            break;
        case NodeType.Shape:
            Shape childShape = (Shape)child;
            Console.WriteLine("Shape:");
            Console.WriteLine($"\t{childShape.ShapeType}, {childShape.Width}x{childShape.Height}");
            break;
    }
```
