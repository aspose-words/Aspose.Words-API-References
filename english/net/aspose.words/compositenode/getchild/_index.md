## CompositeNode.GetChild method

Returns an Nth child node that matches the specified type.

```csharp
public Node GetChild(NodeType nodeType, int index, bool isDeep)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| nodeType | NodeType | Specifies the type of the child node. |
| index | Int32 | Zero based index of the child node to select. Negative indexes are also allowed and indicate access from the end, that is -1 means the last node. |
| isDeep | Boolean | True to select from all child nodes recursively. False to select only among immediate children. See remarks for more info. |

## Return Value

The child node that matches the criteria or null if no matching node is found.

### Remarks

If index is out of range, a null is returned.

Note that markup nodes (StructuredDocumentTag and SmartTag) are traversed even when isDeep = false and GetChild is invoked for non-markup node type. For example if the first run in a para is wrapped in a StructuredDocumentTag, it will still be returned by GetChild(NodeType.Run, 0, false).
