## Inline.IsDeleteRevision property

Returns true if this object was deleted in Microsoft Word while change tracking was enabled.

```csharp
public bool IsDeleteRevision { get; }
```

### Examples

Shows how to determine the revision type of an inline node.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Revision runs.docx");

// When we edit the document while the "Track Changes" option, found in via Review -> Tracking,
// is turned on in Microsoft Word, the changes we apply count as revisions.
// When editing a document using Aspose.Words, we can begin tracking revisions by
// invoking the document's "StartTrackRevisions" method and stop tracking by using the "StopTrackRevisions" method.
// We can either accept revisions to assimilate them into the document
// or reject them to change the proposed change effectively.
Assert.AreEqual(6, doc.Revisions.Count);

// The parent node of a revision is the run that the revision concerns. A Run is an Inline node.
Run run = (Run)doc.Revisions[0].ParentNode;

Paragraph firstParagraph = run.ParentParagraph;
RunCollection runs = firstParagraph.Runs;

Assert.AreEqual(6, runs.ToArray().Length);

// Below are five types of revisions that can flag an Inline node.
// 1 -  An "insert" revision:
// This revision occurs when we insert text while tracking changes.
Assert.IsTrue(runs[2].IsInsertRevision);

// 2 -  A "format" revision:
// This revision occurs when we change the formatting of text while tracking changes.
Assert.IsTrue(runs[2].IsFormatRevision);

// 3 -  A "move from" revision:
// When we highlight text in Microsoft Word, and then drag it to a different place in the document
// while tracking changes, two revisions appear.
// The "move from" revision is a copy of the text originally before we moved it.
Assert.IsTrue(runs[4].IsMoveFromRevision);

// 4 -  A "move to" revision:
// The "move to" revision is the text that we moved in its new position in the document.
// "Move from" and "move to" revisions appear in pairs for every move revision we carry out.
// Accepting a move revision deletes the "move from" revision and its text,
// and keeps the text from the "move to" revision.
// Rejecting a move revision conversely keeps the "move from" revision and deletes the "move to" revision.
Assert.IsTrue(runs[1].IsMoveToRevision);

// 5 -  A "delete" revision:
// This revision occurs when we delete text while tracking changes. When we delete text like this,
// it will stay in the document as a revision until we either accept the revision,
// which will delete the text for good, or reject the revision, which will keep the text we deleted where it was.
Assert.IsTrue(runs[5].IsDeleteRevision);
```
