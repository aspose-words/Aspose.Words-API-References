## Story class

Base class for elements that contain block-level nodes [`Paragraph`](../paragraph) and [`Table`](../../aspose.words.tables/table).

```csharp
public abstract class Story : CompositeNode
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [FirstParagraph](firstparagraph) { get; } | Gets the first paragraph in the story. |
| [LastParagraph](lastparagraph) { get; } | Gets the last paragraph in the story. |
| [Paragraphs](paragraphs) { get; } | Gets a collection of paragraphs that are immediate children of the story. |
| [StoryType](storytype) { get; } | Gets the type of this story. |
| [Tables](tables) { get; } | Gets a collection of tables that are immediate children of the story. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AppendParagraph](appendparagraph)(string) | A shortcut method that creates a [`Paragraph`](../paragraph) object with optional text and appends it to the end of this object. |
| [DeleteShapes](deleteshapes)() | Deletes all shapes from the text of this story. |

### Remarks

Text of a Word document is said to consist of several stories. The main text is stored in the main text story represented by [`Body`](../body), each header and footer is stored in a separate story represented by [`HeaderFooter`](../headerfooter).

### Examples

Shows how to remove all shapes from a node.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

// Use a DocumentBuilder to insert a shape. This is an inline shape,
// which has a parent Paragraph, which is a child node of the first section's Body.
builder.InsertShape(ShapeType.Cube, 100.0, 100.0);

Assert.AreEqual(1, doc.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Shape, true).Count);

// We can delete all shapes from the child paragraphs of this Body.
Assert.AreEqual(StoryType.MainText, doc.FirstSection.Body.StoryType);
doc.FirstSection.Body.DeleteShapes();

Assert.AreEqual(0, doc.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Shape, true).Count);
```
