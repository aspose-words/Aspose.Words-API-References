## NodeList class

Represents a collection of nodes matching an XPath query executed using the [`SelectNodes`](../compositenode/selectnodes) method.

```csharp
public class NodeList : IEnumerable<Node>
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [Count](count) { get; } | Gets the number of nodes in the list. |
| [Item](item) { get; } | Retrieves a node at the given index. |
| [GetEnumerator](getenumerator)() | Provides a simple "foreach" style iteration over the collection of nodes. |
| [ToArray](toarray)() | Copies all nodes from the collection to a new array of nodes. |

## Remarks

NodeList is returned by [`SelectNodes`](../compositenode/selectnodes) and contains a collection of nodes matching the XPath query.NodeList supports indexed access and iteration.Treat the NodeList collection as a "snapshot" collection. NodeList starts as a "live" collection because the nodes are not actually retrieved when the XPath query is run. The nodes are only retrieved upon access and at this time the node and all nodes that precede it are cached forming a "snapshot" collection.
