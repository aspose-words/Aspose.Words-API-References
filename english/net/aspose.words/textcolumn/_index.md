## TextColumn class

Represents a single text column. **TextColumn** is a member of the [`TextColumnCollection`](../textcolumncollection) collection. The **TextColumns** collection includes all the columns in a section of a document.

```csharp
public class TextColumn
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [SpaceAfter](spaceafter) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the space between this column and the next column in points. Not required for the last column. |
| [Width](width) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the width of the text column in points. |

### Remarks

**TextColumn** objects are only used to specify columns with custom width and spacing. If you want the columns in the document to be of equal width, set TextColumns.[`EvenlySpaced`](../textcolumncollection/evenlyspaced) to **true**.

When a new **TextColumn** is created it has its width and spacing set to zero.
