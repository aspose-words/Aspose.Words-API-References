## Border.Shadow property

Gets or sets a value indicating whether the border has a shadow.

```csharp
public bool Shadow { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

In Microsoft Word, for a border to have a shadow, the borders on all four sides (left, top, right and bottom) should be of the same type, width, color and all should have the Shadow property set to true.
