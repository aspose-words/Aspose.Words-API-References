## Remarks

InlineStory is a container for block-level nodes [`Paragraph`](../paragraph) and [`Table`](../../aspose.words.tables/table).The classes that derive from InlineStory are inline-level nodes that can contain their own text (paragraphs and tables). For example, a Comment node contains text of a comment and a Footnote contains text of a footnote.
