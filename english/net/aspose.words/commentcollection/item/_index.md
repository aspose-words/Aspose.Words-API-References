## Remarks

The index is zero-based.Negative indexes are allowed and indicate access from the back of the collection. For example -1 means the last item, -2 means the second before last and so on.If index is greater than or equal to the number of items in the list, this returns a null reference.If index is negative and its absolute value is greater than the number of items in the list, this returns a null reference.
