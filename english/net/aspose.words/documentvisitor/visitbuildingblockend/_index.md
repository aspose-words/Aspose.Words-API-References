## DocumentVisitor.VisitBuildingBlockEnd method

Called when enumeration of a building block has ended.

```csharp
public virtual VisitorAction VisitBuildingBlockEnd(BuildingBlock block)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| block | BuildingBlock | The object that is being visited. |

## Return Value

A [`VisitorAction`](../../visitoraction) value that specifies how to continue the enumeration.

### Remarks

Note: A building block node and its children are not visited when you execute a Visitor over a [`Document`](../../document). If you want to execute a Visitor over a building block, you need to execute the visitor over [`GlossaryDocument`](../../../aspose.words.buildingblocks/glossarydocument) or call [`Accept`](../../../aspose.words.buildingblocks/buildingblock/accept).
