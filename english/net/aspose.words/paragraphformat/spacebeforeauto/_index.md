## ParagraphFormat.SpaceBeforeAuto property

True if the amount of spacing before the paragraph is set automatically.

```csharp
public bool SpaceBeforeAuto { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

When set to true, overrides the effect of [`SpaceBefore`](../spacebefore).

When you set paragraph Space Before and Space After to Auto, Microsoft Word adds 14 points spacing between paragraphs automatically according to the following rules:

* Normally, spacing is added after all paragraphs.
* In a bulleted or numbered list, spacing is added only after the last item in the list. Spacing is not added between the list items.
* In a nested bulleted or numbered list spacing is not added.
* Spacing is normally added after a table.
* Spacing is not added after a table if it is the last block in a table cell.
* Spacing is not added after the last paragraph in a table cell.
