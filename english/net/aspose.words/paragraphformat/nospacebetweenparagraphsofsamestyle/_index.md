## ParagraphFormat.NoSpaceBetweenParagraphsOfSameStyle property

When true, [`SpaceBefore`](../spacebefore) and [`SpaceAfter`](../spaceafter) will be ignored between the paragraphs of the same style.

```csharp
public bool NoSpaceBetweenParagraphsOfSameStyle { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

This setting only takes affect when applied to a paragraph style. If applied to a paragraph directly, it has no effect.
