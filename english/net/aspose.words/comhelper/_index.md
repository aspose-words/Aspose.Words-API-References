Provides methods for COM clients to load a document into Aspose.Words.

```csharp
public class ComHelper
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [ComHelper](comhelper)() | Initializes a new instance of this class. |
| [Open](open)(…) | Allows a COM application to load a [`Document`](../document) from a file. (2 methods) |
| [OpenIStream](openistream)(…) | Allows a COM application to load a [`Document`](../document) from an IStream object. |

## Remarks

Use the [`ComHelper`](../comhelper) class to load a document from a file or stream into a [`Document`](../document) object in a COM application.The [`Document`](../document) class provides a default constructor to create a new document and also provides overloaded constructors to load a document from a file or stream. If you are using Aspose.Words from a .NET application, you can use all of the [`Document`](../document) constructors directly, but if you are using Aspose.Words from a COM application, only the default [`Document`](../document) constructor is available.

## Examples

```csharp
[VBScript]

Dim helper
Set helper = CreateObject("Aspose.Words.ComHelper")

Dim doc
Set doc = helper.Open(fileName)
```
