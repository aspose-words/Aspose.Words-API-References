## Metered class

Provides methods to set metered key.

```csharp
public class Metered
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Metered](metered/)() | Initializes a new instance of this class. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [GetProductName](../../aspose.words/metered/getproductname/)() | Returns Product name |
| [SetMeteredKey](../../aspose.words/metered/setmeteredkey/)(*string, string*) | Sets metered public and private key. If you purchase metered license, when start application, this API should be called, normally, this is enough. However, if always fail to upload consumption data and exceed 24 hours, the license will be set to evaluation status, to avoid such case, you should regularly check the license status, if it is evaluation status, call this API again. |
| static [GetConsumptionCredit](../../aspose.words/metered/getconsumptioncredit/)() | Gets consumption credit |
| static [GetConsumptionQuantity](../../aspose.words/metered/getconsumptionquantity/)() | Gets consumption file size |
| static [IsMeteredLicensed](../../aspose.words/metered/ismeteredlicensed/)() | Check whether metered is licensed |

## Examples

In this example, an attempt will be made to set metered public and private key

```csharp
[C#]

Metered matered = new Metered();
matered.SetMeteredKey("PublicKey", "PrivateKey");


[Visual Basic]

Dim matered As Metered = New Metered
matered.SetMeteredKey("PublicKey", "PrivateKey")
```

Shows how to activate a Metered license and track credit/consumption.

```csharp
// Create a new Metered license, and then print its usage statistics.
Metered metered = new Metered();
metered.SetMeteredKey("MyPublicKey", "MyPrivateKey");

Console.WriteLine($"Is metered license accepted: {Metered.IsMeteredLicensed()}");
Console.WriteLine($"Product name: {metered.GetProductName()}");
Console.WriteLine($"Credit before operation: {Metered.GetConsumptionCredit()}");
Console.WriteLine($"Consumption quantity before operation: {Metered.GetConsumptionQuantity()}");

// Operate using Aspose.Words, and then print our metered stats again to see how much we spent.
Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Document.docx");
doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "Metered.Usage.pdf");

// Aspose Metered Licensing mechanism does not send the usage data to purchase server every time,
// you need to use waiting.
System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10000);

Console.WriteLine($"Credit after operation: {Metered.GetConsumptionCredit()}");
Console.WriteLine($"Consumption quantity after operation: {Metered.GetConsumptionQuantity()}");
```
