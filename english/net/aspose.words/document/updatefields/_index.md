## Document.UpdateFields method

Updates the values of fields in the whole document.

```csharp
public void UpdateFields()
```

### Remarks

When you open, modify and then save a document, Aspose.Words does not update fields automatically, it keeps them intact. Therefore, you would usually want to call this method before saving if you have modified the document programmatically and want to make sure the proper (calculated) field values appear in the saved document.

There is no need to update fields after executing a mail merge because mail merge is a kind of field update and automatically updates all fields in the document.

This method does not update all field types. For the detailed list of supported field types, see the Programmers Guide.

This method does not update fields that are related to the page layout algorithms (e.g. PAGE, PAGES, PAGEREF). The page layout-related fields are updated when you render a document or call [`UpdatePageLayout`](../updatepagelayout).

Use the [`NormalizeFieldTypes`](../normalizefieldtypes) method before fields updating if there were document changes that affected field types.

To update fields in a specific part of the document use [`UpdateFields`](../../range/updatefields).
