## Document.Revisions property

Gets a collection of revisions (tracked changes) that exist in this document.

```csharp
public RevisionCollection Revisions { get; }
```

## Remarks

The returned collection is a "live" collection, which means if you remove parts of a document that contain revisions, the deleted revisions will automatically disappear from this collection.
