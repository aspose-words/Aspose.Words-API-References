## Document.PackageCustomParts property

Gets or sets the collection of custom parts (arbitrary content) that are linked to the OOXML package using "unknown relationships".

```csharp
public CustomPartCollection PackageCustomParts { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

Do not confuse these custom parts with Custom XML Data. If you need to access Custom XML parts, use the [`CustomXmlParts`](../customxmlparts) property.

This collection contains OOXML parts whose parent is the OOXML package and they targets are of an "unknown relationship". For more information see [`CustomPart`](../../../aspose.words.markup/custompart).

Aspose.Words loads and saves custom parts into OOXML documents only.

This property cannot be `null`.
