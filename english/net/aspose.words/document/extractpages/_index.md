## Document.ExtractPages method

Returns the [`Document`](../../document) object representing specified range of pages.

```csharp
public Document ExtractPages(int index, int count)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| index | The zero-based index of the first page to extract. |
| count | Number of pages to be extracted. |

## Remarks

The resulting document should look like the one in MS Word, as if we had performed 'Print specific pages' – the numbering, headers/footers and cross tables layout will be preserved. But due to a large number of nuances, appearing while reducing the number of pages, full match of the layout is a quiet complicated task requiring a lot of effort. Depending on the document complexity there might be slight differences in the resulting document contents layout comparing to the source document. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
