## Document.Protect method (1 of 2)

Protects the document from changes without changing the existing password or assigns a random password.

```csharp
public void Protect(ProtectionType type)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type | ProtectionType | Specifies the protection type for the document. |

### Remarks

When a document is protected, the user can make only limited changes, such as adding annotations, making revisions, or completing a form.

When you protect a document, and the document already has a protection password, the existing protection password is not changed.

When you protect a document, and the document does not have a protection password, this method assigns a random password that makes it impossible to unprotect the document in Microsoft Word, but you still can unprotect the document in Aspose.Words as it does not require a password when unprotecting.

```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type | ProtectionType | Specifies the protection type for the document. |
| password | String | The password to protect the document with. Specify null or empty string if you want to protect the document without a password. |

### Remarks

When a document is protected, the user can make only limited changes, such as adding annotations, making revisions, or completing a form.
