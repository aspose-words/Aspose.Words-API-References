## DocumentBuilder.MoveToBookmark method (1 of 2)

Moves the cursor to a bookmark.

```csharp
public bool MoveToBookmark(string bookmarkName)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bookmarkName | String | The name of the bookmark to move the cursor to. |

## Return Value

True if the bookmark was found; false otherwise.

### Remarks

Moves the cursor to a position just after the start of the bookmark with the specified name.

The comparison is not case-sensitive. If the bookmark was not found, false is returned and the cursor is not moved.

Inserting new text does not replace existing text of the bookmark.

Note that some bookmarks in the document are assigned to form fields. Moving to such a bookmark and inserting text there inserts the text into the form field code. Although this will not invalidate the form field, the inserted text will not be visible because it becomes part of the field code.

public bool MoveToBookmark(string bookmarkName, bool isStart, bool isAfter)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |

| bookmarkName | String | The name of the bookmark to move the cursor to. |
| isStart | Boolean | When true, moves the cursor to the beginning of the bookmark. When false, moves the cursor to the end of the bookmark. |
| isAfter | Boolean | When true, moves the cursor to be after the bookmark start or end position. When false, moves the cursor to be before the bookmark start or end position. |

## Return Value

True if the bookmark was found; false otherwise.

### Remarks

Moves the cursor to a position before or after the bookmark start or end.

If desired position is not at inline level, moves to the next paragraph.
