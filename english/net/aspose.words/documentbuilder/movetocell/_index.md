```

| tableIndex | Int32 | The index of the table to move to. |
| rowIndex | Int32 | The index of the row in the table. |
| columnIndex | Int32 | The index of the column in the table. |
| characterIndex | Int32 | The index of the character inside the cell. A negative value allows you to specify a position from the end of the cell. Use -1 to move to the end of the cell. |
