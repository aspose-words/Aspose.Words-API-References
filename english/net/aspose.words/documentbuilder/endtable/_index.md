## DocumentBuilder.EndTable method

Ends a table in the document.

```csharp
public Table EndTable()
```

## Return Value

The table node that was just finished.

### Remarks

This method should be called only once after [`EndRow`](../endrow) was called. When called, **EndTable** moves the cursor out of the current cell to point just after the table.
