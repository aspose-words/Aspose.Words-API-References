## DocumentBuilder.InsertField method (3 of 3)

Inserts a Word field into a document without updating the field result.

```csharp
public Field InsertField(string fieldCode, string fieldValue)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| fieldCode | The field code to insert (without curly braces). |
| fieldValue | The field value to insert. Pass null for fields that do not have a value. |

## Return Value

A [`Field`](../../../aspose.words.fields/field) object that represents the inserted field.

## Remarks

Fields in Microsoft Word documents consist of a field code and a field result. The field code is like a formula and the field result is like the value that the formula produces. The field code may also contain field switches that are like additional instructions to perform a specific action.You can switch between displaying field codes and results in your document in Microsoft Word using the keyboard shortcut Alt+F9. Field codes appear between curly braces ( { } ).To create a field, you need to specify a field type, field code and a "placeholder" field value. If you are not sure about a particular field code syntax, create the field in Microsoft Word first and switch to see its field code.

Aspose.Words can calculate field results for most of the field types, but this method does not update the field result automatically. Because the field result is not calculated automatically, you are expected to pass some string value (or even an empty string) that will be inserted into the field result. This value will remain in the field result as a placeholder until the field is updated. To update the field result you can call [`Update`](../../../aspose.words.fields/field/update) on the field object returned to you or [`UpdateFields`](../../document/updatefields) to update fields in the whole document.
