## DocumentBuilder.MoveTo method

Moves the cursor to an inline node or to the end of a paragraph.

```csharp
public void MoveTo(Node node)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| node | Node | The node must be a paragraph or a direct child of a paragraph. |

### Remarks

When node is an inline-level node, the cursor is moved to this node and further content will be inserted before that node.

When node is a **Paragraph**, the cursor is moved to the end of the paragraph and further content will be inserted just before the paragraph break.

When node is a block-level node but not a Paragraph, the cursor is moved to the end of the first paragraph into block-level node and further content will be inserted just before the paragraph break.
