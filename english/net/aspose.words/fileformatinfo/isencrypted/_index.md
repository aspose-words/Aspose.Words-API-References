## FileFormatInfo.IsEncrypted property

Returns true if the document is encrypted and requires a password to open.

```csharp
public bool IsEncrypted { get; }
```

## Remarks

This property exists to help you sort documents that are encrypted from those that are not. If you attempt to load an encrypted document using Aspose.Words without supplying a password an exception will be thrown. You can use this property to detect whether a document requires a password and take some action before loading a document, for example, prompt the user for a password.
