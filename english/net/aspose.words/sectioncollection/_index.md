## Remarks

A Microsoft Word document can contain multiple sections. To create a section in a Microsoft Word, select the Insert/Break command and select a break type. The break specifies whether section starts on a new page or on the same page.Programmatically inserting and removing sections can be used to customize documents produced during mail merge. If a document needs to have different content or parts of the content depending on some criteria, then you can create a "master" document that contains multiple sections and delete some of the sections before or after mail merge.
