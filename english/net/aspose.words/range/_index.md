### Remarks

The document is represented by a tree of nodes and the nodes provide operations to work with the tree, but some operations are easier to perform if the document is treated as a contiguous sequence of text.

**Range** is a "facade" interface that provide methods that treat the document or portions of the document as "flat" text regardless of the fact that the document nodes are stored in a tree-like object model.

**Range** does not contain any text or nodes, it is merely a view or "window" over a fragment of a document.
