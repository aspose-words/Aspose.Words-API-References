| [Delete](../../aspose.words/range/delete/)() | Deletes all characters of the range. |
| [NormalizeFieldTypes](../../aspose.words/range/normalizefieldtypes/)() | Changes field type values [`FieldType`](../../aspose.words.fields/fieldchar/fieldtype/) of [`FieldStart`](../../aspose.words.fields/fieldstart/), [`FieldSeparator`](../../aspose.words.fields/fieldseparator/), [`FieldEnd`](../../aspose.words.fields/fieldend/) in this range so that they correspond to the field types contained in the field codes. |

| [UpdateFields](../../aspose.words/range/updatefields/)() | Updates the values of document fields in this range. |

## Remarks

The document is represented by a tree of nodes and the nodes provide operations to work with the tree, but some operations are easier to perform if the document is treated as a contiguous sequence of text.

`Range` is a "facade" interface that provide methods that treat the document or portions of the document as "flat" text regardless of the fact that the document nodes are stored in a tree-like object model.

`Range` does not contain any text or nodes, it is merely a view or "window" over a fragment of a document.

## Examples

Shows how to get the text contents of all the nodes that a range covers.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

builder.Write("Hello world!");

Assert.AreEqual("Hello world!", doc.Range.Text.Trim());
```
