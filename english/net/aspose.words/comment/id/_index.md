## Comment.Id property

Gets the comment identifier.

```csharp
public int Id { get; }
```

### Remarks

The comment identifier allows to anchor a comment to a region of text in the document. The region must be demarcated using the [`CommentRangeStart`](../../commentrangestart) and [`CommentRangeEnd`](../../commentrangeend) object sharing the same identifier value as the [`Comment`](../../comment) object.

You would use this value when looking for the [`CommentRangeStart`](../../commentrangestart) and [`CommentRangeEnd`](../../commentrangeend) nodes that are linked to this comment.

Comment identifiers are supposed to be unique across a document and Aspose.Words automatically maintains comment identifiers when loading, saving and combining documents.
