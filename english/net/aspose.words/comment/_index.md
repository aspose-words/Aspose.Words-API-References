### Remarks

A comment is an annotation which is anchored to a region of text or to a position in text. A comment can contain an arbitrary amount of block-level content.

If a [`Comment`](../comment) object occurs on its own, the comment is anchored to the position of the [`Comment`](../comment) object.

To anchor a comment to a region of text three objects are required: [`Comment`](../comment), [`CommentRangeStart`](../commentrangestart) and [`CommentRangeEnd`](../commentrangeend). All three objects need to share the same [`Id`](./id) value.

[`Comment`](../comment) is an inline-level node and can only be a child of [`Paragraph`](../paragraph).

[`Comment`](../comment) can contain [`Paragraph`](../paragraph) and [`Table`](../../aspose.words.tables/table) child nodes.

### Examples

Shows how to add a comment to a paragraph.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
builder.Write("Hello world!");

Comment comment = new Comment(doc, "John Doe", "JD", DateTime.Today);
builder.CurrentParagraph.AppendChild(comment);
builder.MoveTo(comment.AppendChild(new Paragraph(doc)));
builder.Write("Comment text.");

Assert.AreEqual(DateTime.Today, comment.DateTime);

// In Microsoft Word, we can right-click this comment in the document body to edit it, or reply to it. 
doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "InlineStory.AddComment.docx");
```

Shows how to add a comment to a document, and then reply to it.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

Comment comment = new Comment(doc, "John Doe", "J.D.", DateTime.Now);
comment.SetText("My comment.");

// Place the comment at a node in the document's body.
// This comment will show up at the location of its paragraph,
// outside the right-side margin of the page, and with a dotted line connecting it to its paragraph.
builder.CurrentParagraph.AppendChild(comment);

// Add a reply, which will show up under its parent comment.
comment.AddReply("Joe Bloggs", "J.B.", DateTime.Now, "New reply");

// Comments and replies are both Comment nodes.
Assert.AreEqual(2, doc.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Comment, true).Count);

// Comments that do not reply to other comments are "top-level". They have no ancestor comments.
Assert.Null(comment.Ancestor);

// Replies have an ancestor top-level comment.
Assert.AreEqual(comment, comment.Replies[0].Ancestor);

doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "Comment.AddCommentWithReply.docx");
```
