### Remarks

A comment is an annotation which is anchored to a region of text or to a position in text. A comment can contain an arbitrary amount of block-level content.

If a [`Comment`](../comment) object occurs on its own, the comment is anchored to the position of the [`Comment`](../comment) object.

To anchor a comment to a region of text three objects are required: [`Comment`](../comment), [`CommentRangeStart`](../commentrangestart) and [`CommentRangeEnd`](../commentrangeend). All three objects need to share the same [`Id`](./id) value.

[`Comment`](../comment) is an inline-level node and can only be a child of [`Paragraph`](../paragraph).

[`Comment`](../comment) can contain [`Paragraph`](../paragraph) and [`Table`](../../aspose.words.tables/table) child nodes.
