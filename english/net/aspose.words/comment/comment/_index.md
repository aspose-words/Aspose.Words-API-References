## Comment constructor (1 of 2)

Initializes a new instance of the **Comment** class.

```csharp
public Comment(DocumentBase doc)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| doc | DocumentBase | The owner document. |

### Remarks

When **Comment** is created, it belongs to the specified document, but is not yet part of the document and **ParentNode** is null.

To append **Comment** to the document use InsertAfter or InsertBefore on the paragraph where you want the comment inserted.

After creating a comment, don't forget to set its [`Author`](../author), [`Initial`](../initial) and [`DateTime`](../datetime) properties.
