## Section.ClearHeadersFooters method

Clears the headers and footers of this section.

```csharp
public void ClearHeadersFooters()
```

### Remarks

The text of all headers and footers is cleared, but [`HeaderFooter`](../../headerfooter) objects themselves are not removed.

This makes headers and footers of this section linked to headers and footers of the previous section.
