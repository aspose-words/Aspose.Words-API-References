public sealed class Section : CompositeNode
```

## Constructors

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Body](body) { get; } | Returns the **Body** child node of the section. |
| [HeadersFooters](headersfooters) { get; } | Provides access to the headers and footers nodes of the section. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| override [Accept](accept)(DocumentVisitor) | Accepts a visitor. |
| [AppendContent](appendcontent)(Section) | Inserts a copy of content of the source section at the end of this section. |
| [ClearContent](clearcontent)() | Clears the section. |
| [ClearHeadersFooters](clearheadersfooters)() | Clears the headers and footers of this section. |
| [Clone](clone)() | Creates a duplicate of this section. |
| [DeleteHeaderFooterShapes](deleteheaderfootershapes)() | Deletes all shapes (drawing objects) from the headers and footers of this section. |
| [EnsureMinimum](ensureminimum)() | Ensures that the section has Body with one Paragraph. |
| [PrependContent](prependcontent)(Section) | Inserts a copy of content of the source section at the beginning of this section. |

### Remarks

**Section** can have one [`Body`](./body) and maximum one [`HeaderFooter`](../headerfooter) of each [`HeaderFooterType`](../headerfootertype). **Body** and **HeaderFooter** nodes can be in any order inside **Section**.

A minimal valid section needs to have **Body** with one **Paragraph**.

Each section has its own set of properties that specify page size, orientation, margins etc.

You can create a copy of a section using [`Clone`](../node/clone). The copy can be inserted into the same or different document.

To add, insert or remove a whole section including section break and section properties use methods of the **Sections** object.

To copy and insert just content of the section excluding the section break and section properties use **AppendContent** and **PrependContent** methods.
