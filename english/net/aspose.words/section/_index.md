## Section class

Represents a single section in a document.

```csharp
public sealed class Section : CompositeNode
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Section](section)(DocumentBase) | Initializes a new instance of the Section class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Body](body) { get; } | Returns the **Body** child node of the section. |
| [HeadersFooters](headersfooters) { get; } | Provides access to the headers and footers nodes of the section. |
| override [NodeType](nodetype) { get; } | Returns **NodeType.Section**. |
| [PageSetup](pagesetup) { get; } | Returns an object that represents page setup and section properties. |
| [ProtectedForForms](protectedforforms) { get; set; } | True if the section is protected for forms. When a section is protected for forms, users can select and modify text only in form fields in Microsoft Word. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| override [Accept](accept)(DocumentVisitor) | Accepts a visitor. |
| [AppendContent](appendcontent)(Section) | Inserts a copy of content of the source section at the end of this section. |
| [ClearContent](clearcontent)() | Clears the section. |
| [ClearHeadersFooters](clearheadersfooters)() | Clears the headers and footers of this section. |
| [Clone](clone)() | Creates a duplicate of this section. |
| [DeleteHeaderFooterShapes](deleteheaderfootershapes)() | Deletes all shapes (drawing objects) from the headers and footers of this section. |
| [EnsureMinimum](ensureminimum)() | Ensures that the section has Body with one Paragraph. |
| [PrependContent](prependcontent)(Section) | Inserts a copy of content of the source section at the beginning of this section. |

### Remarks

**Section** can have one [`Body`](./body) and maximum one [`HeaderFooter`](../headerfooter) of each [`HeaderFooterType`](../headerfootertype). **Body** and **HeaderFooter** nodes can be in any order inside **Section**.

A minimal valid section needs to have **Body** with one **Paragraph**.

Each section has its own set of properties that specify page size, orientation, margins etc.

You can create a copy of a section using [`Clone`](../node/clone). The copy can be inserted into the same or different document.

To add, insert or remove a whole section including section break and section properties use methods of the **Sections** object.

To copy and insert just content of the section excluding the section break and section properties use **AppendContent** and **PrependContent** methods.

### Examples

Shows how to construct an Aspose.Words document by hand.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();

// A blank document contains one section, one body and one paragraph.
// Call the "RemoveAllChildren" method to remove all those nodes,
// and end up with a document node with no children.
doc.RemoveAllChildren();

// This document now has no composite child nodes that we can add content to.
// If we wish to edit it, we will need to repopulate its node collection.
// First, create a new section, and then append it as a child to the root document node.
Section section = new Section(doc);
doc.AppendChild(section);

// Set some page setup properties for the section.
section.PageSetup.SectionStart = SectionStart.NewPage;
section.PageSetup.PaperSize = PaperSize.Letter;

// A section needs a body, which will contain and display all its contents
// on the page between the section's header and footer.
Body body = new Body(doc);
section.AppendChild(body);

// Create a paragraph, set some formatting properties, and then append it as a child to the body.
Paragraph para = new Paragraph(doc);

para.ParagraphFormat.StyleName = "Heading 1";
para.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = ParagraphAlignment.Center;

body.AppendChild(para);

// Finally, add some content to do the document. Create a run,
// set its appearance and contents, and then append it as a child to the paragraph.
Run run = new Run(doc);
run.Text = "Hello World!";
run.Font.Color = Color.Red;
para.AppendChild(run);

Assert.AreEqual("Hello World!", doc.GetText().Trim());

doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "Section.CreateManually.docx");
```
