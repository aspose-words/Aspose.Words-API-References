## DocumentBase.BackgroundShape property

Gets or sets the background shape of the document. Can be null.

```csharp
public Shape BackgroundShape { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Microsoft Word allows only a shape that has its [`ShapeType`](../../../aspose.words.drawing/shapebase/shapetype) property equal to Rectangle to be used as a background shape for a document.

Microsoft Word supports only the fill properties of a background shape. All other properties are ignored.

Setting this property to a non-null value will also set the [`DisplayBackgroundShape`](../../../aspose.words.settings/viewoptions/displaybackgroundshape) to true.
