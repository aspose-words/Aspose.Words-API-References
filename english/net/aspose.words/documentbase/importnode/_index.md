## DocumentBase.ImportNode method (1 of 2)

Imports a node from another document to the current document.

```csharp
public Node ImportNode(Node srcNode, bool isImportChildren)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| srcNode | Node | The node being imported. |
| isImportChildren | Boolean | True to import all child nodes recursively; otherwise, false. |

## Return Value

The cloned node that belongs to the current document.

### Remarks

This method uses the UseDestinationStyles option to resolve formatting.

Importing a node creates a copy of the source node belonging to the importing document. The returned node has no parent. The source node is not altered or removed from the original document.

Before a node from another document can be inserted into this document, it must be imported. During import, document-specific properties such as references to styles and lists are translated from the original to the importing document. After the node was imported, it can be inserted into the appropriate place in the document using [`InsertBefore`](../../compositenode/insertbefore) or [`InsertAfter`](../../compositenode/insertafter).

If the source node already belongs to the destination document, then simply a deep clone of the source node is created.

## DocumentBase.ImportNode method (2 of 2)

Imports a node from another document to the current document with an option to control formatting.

```csharp
public Node ImportNode(Node srcNode, bool isImportChildren, ImportFormatMode importFormatMode)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| srcNode | Node | The node to imported. |
| isImportChildren | Boolean | True to import all child nodes recursively; otherwise, false. |
| importFormatMode | ImportFormatMode | Specifies how to merge style formatting that clashes. |

## Return Value

The cloned, imported node. The node belongs to the destination document, but has no parent.

### Remarks

This overload is useful to control how styles and list formatting are imported.

Importing a node creates a copy of the source node belonging to the importing document. The returned node has no parent. The source node is not altered or removed from the original document.

Before a node from another document can be inserted into this document, it must be imported. During import, document-specific properties such as references to styles and lists are translated from the original to the importing document. After the node was imported, it can be inserted into the appropriate place in the document using [`InsertBefore`](../../compositenode/insertbefore) or [`InsertAfter`](../../compositenode/insertafter).

If the source node already belongs to the destination document, then simply a deep clone of the source node is created.
