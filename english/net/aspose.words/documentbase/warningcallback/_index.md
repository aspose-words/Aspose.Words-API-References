## DocumentBase.WarningCallback property

Called during various document processing procedures when an issue is detected that might result in data or formatting fidelity loss.

```csharp
public IWarningCallback WarningCallback { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Document may generate warnings at any stage of its existence, so it's important to setup warning callback as early as possible to avoid the warnings loss. E.g. such properties as [`PageCount`](../../document/pagecount) actually build the document layout which is used later for rendering, and the layout warnings may be lost if warning callback is specified just for the rendering calls later.
