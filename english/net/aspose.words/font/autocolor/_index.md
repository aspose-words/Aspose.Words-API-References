## Font.AutoColor property

Returns the present calculated color of the text (black or white) to be used for 'auto color'. If the color is not 'auto' then returns [`Color`](../color).

```csharp
public Color AutoColor { get; }
```

## Remarks

When text has 'automatic color', the actual color of text is calculated automatically so that it is readable against the background color. As you change the background color, the text color will automatically switch to black or white in MS Word to maximize legibility.
