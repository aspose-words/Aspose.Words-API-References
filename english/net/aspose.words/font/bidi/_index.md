## Font.Bidi property

Specifies whether the contents of this run shall have right-to-left characteristics.

```csharp
public bool Bidi { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

This property, when on, shall not be used with strongly left-to-right text. Any behavior under that condition is unspecified. This property, when off, shall not be used with strong right-to-left text. Any behavior under that condition is unspecified.

When the contents of this run are displayed, all characters shall be treated as complex script characters for formatting purposes. This means that [`BoldBi`](../boldbi), [`ItalicBi`](../italicbi), [`SizeBi`](../sizebi) and a corresponding font name will be used when rendering this run.

Also, when the contents of this run are displayed, this property acts as a right-to-left override for characters which are classified as "weak types" and "neutral types".
