## NodeCollection class

Represents a collection of nodes of a specific type.

```csharp
public class NodeCollection : IEnumerable<Node>
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Count](count) { get; } | Gets the number of nodes in the collection. |
| [Item](item) { get; } | Retrieves a node at the given index. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Add](add)(Node) | Adds a node to the end of the collection. |
| [Clear](clear)() | Removes all nodes from this collection and from the document. |
| [Contains](contains)(Node) | Determines whether a node is in the collection. |
| [GetEnumerator](getenumerator)() | Provides a simple "foreach" style iteration over the collection of nodes. |
| [IndexOf](indexof)(Node) | Returns the zero-based index of the specified node. |
| [Insert](insert)(int, Node) | Inserts a node into the collection at the specified index. |
| [Remove](remove)(Node) | Removes the node from the collection and from the document. |
| [RemoveAt](removeat)(int) | Removes the node at the specified index from the collection and from the document. |
| [ToArray](toarray)() | Copies all nodes from the collection to a new array of nodes. |

### Remarks

**NodeCollection** does not own the nodes it contains, rather, is just a selection of nodes of the specified type, but the nodes are stored in the tree under their respective parent nodes.

**NodeCollection** supports indexed access, iteration and provides add and remove methods.

The **NodeCollection** collection is "live", i.e. changes to the children of the node object that it was created from are immediately reflected in the nodes returned by the **NodeCollection** properties and methods.

**NodeCollection** is returned by [`GetChildNodes`](../compositenode/getchildnodes) and also serves as a base class for typed node collections such as [`SectionCollection`](../sectioncollection), [`ParagraphCollection`](../paragraphcollection) etc.

**NodeCollection** can be "flat" and contain only immediate children of the node it was created from, or it can be "deep" and contain all descendant children.

### Examples

Shows how to replace all textbox shapes with image shapes.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Textboxes in drawing canvas.docx");

Shape[] shapes = doc.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Shape, true).OfType<Shape>().ToArray();

Assert.AreEqual(3, shapes.Count(s => s.ShapeType == ShapeType.TextBox));
Assert.AreEqual(1, shapes.Count(s => s.ShapeType == ShapeType.Image));

foreach (Shape shape in shapes)
{
    if (shape.ShapeType == ShapeType.TextBox)
    {
        Shape replacementShape = new Shape(doc, ShapeType.Image);
        replacementShape.ImageData.SetImage(ImageDir + "Logo.jpg");
        replacementShape.Left = shape.Left;
        replacementShape.Top = shape.Top;
        replacementShape.Width = shape.Width;
        replacementShape.Height = shape.Height;
        replacementShape.RelativeHorizontalPosition = shape.RelativeHorizontalPosition;
        replacementShape.RelativeVerticalPosition = shape.RelativeVerticalPosition;
        replacementShape.HorizontalAlignment = shape.HorizontalAlignment;
        replacementShape.VerticalAlignment = shape.VerticalAlignment;
        replacementShape.WrapType = shape.WrapType;
        replacementShape.WrapSide = shape.WrapSide;

        shape.ParentNode.InsertAfter(replacementShape, shape);
        shape.Remove();
    }
}

shapes = doc.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Shape, true).OfType<Shape>().ToArray();

Assert.AreEqual(0, shapes.Count(s => s.ShapeType == ShapeType.TextBox));
Assert.AreEqual(4, shapes.Count(s => s.ShapeType == ShapeType.Image));

doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "Shape.ReplaceTextboxesWithImages.docx");
```
