| [Item](item) { get; } | Retrieves a node at the given index. |
| [Add](add)(…) | Adds a node to the end of the collection. |
| [Clear](clear)() | Removes all nodes from this collection and from the document. |
| [Contains](contains)(…) | Determines whether a node is in the collection. |
| [GetEnumerator](getenumerator)() | Provides a simple "foreach" style iteration over the collection of nodes. |
| [IndexOf](indexof)(…) | Returns the zero-based index of the specified node. |

## Remarks

NodeCollection does not own the nodes it contains, rather, is just a selection of nodes of the specified type, but the nodes are stored in the tree under their respective parent nodes.NodeCollection supports indexed access, iteration and provides add and remove methods.The NodeCollection collection is "live", i.e. changes to the children of the node object that it was created from are immediately reflected in the nodes returned by the NodeCollection properties and methods.NodeCollection is returned by [`GetChildNodes`](../compositenode/getchildnodes) and also serves as a base class for typed node collections such as [`SectionCollection`](../sectioncollection), [`ParagraphCollection`](../paragraphcollection) etc.NodeCollection can be "flat" and contain only immediate children of the node it was created from, or it can be "deep" and contain all descendant children.
