| --- | --- |
| [Count](../../aspose.words/nodecollection/count) { get; } | Gets the number of nodes in the collection. |
| [Item](../../aspose.words/nodecollection/item) { get; } | Retrieves a node at the given index. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Add](../../aspose.words/nodecollection/add)(Node) | Adds a node to the end of the collection. |
| [Clear](../../aspose.words/nodecollection/clear)() | Removes all nodes from this collection and from the document. |
| [Contains](../../aspose.words/nodecollection/contains)(Node) | Determines whether a node is in the collection. |
| [GetEnumerator](../../aspose.words/nodecollection/getenumerator)() | Provides a simple "foreach" style iteration over the collection of nodes. |
| [IndexOf](../../aspose.words/nodecollection/indexof)(Node) | Returns the zero-based index of the specified node. |
| [Insert](../../aspose.words/nodecollection/insert)(int, Node) | Inserts a node into the collection at the specified index. |
| [Remove](../../aspose.words/nodecollection/remove)(Node) | Removes the node from the collection and from the document. |
| [RemoveAt](../../aspose.words/nodecollection/removeat)(int) | Removes the node at the specified index from the collection and from the document. |
| [ToArray](../../aspose.words/nodecollection/toarray)() | Copies all nodes from the collection to a new array of nodes. |

### Remarks

**NodeCollection** does not own the nodes it contains, rather, is just a selection of nodes of the specified type, but the nodes are stored in the tree under their respective parent nodes.

**NodeCollection** supports indexed access, iteration and provides add and remove methods.

The **NodeCollection** collection is "live", i.e. changes to the children of the node object that it was created from are immediately reflected in the nodes returned by the **NodeCollection** properties and methods.

**NodeCollection** is returned by [`GetChildNodes`](../compositenode/getchildnodes) and also serves as a base class for typed node collections such as [`SectionCollection`](../sectioncollection), [`ParagraphCollection`](../paragraphcollection) etc.

**NodeCollection** can be "flat" and contain only immediate children of the node it was created from, or it can be "deep" and contain all descendant children.
