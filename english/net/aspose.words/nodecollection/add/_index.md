## Exceptions

| --- | --- |
| NotSupportedException | The NodeCollection is a "deep" collection. |

## Remarks

The node is inserted as a child into the node object from which the collection was created.

If the newChild is already in the tree, it is first removed.If the node being inserted was created from another document, you should use [`ImportNode`](../../documentbase/importnode) to import the node to the current document. The imported node can then be inserted into the current document.
