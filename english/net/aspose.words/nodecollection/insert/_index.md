## NodeCollection.Insert method

Inserts a node into the collection at the specified index.

```csharp
public void Insert(int index, Node node)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| index | The zero-based index of the node. Negative indexes are allowed and indicate access from the back of the list. For example -1 means the last node, -2 means the second before last and so on. |
| node | The node to insert. |

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| NotSupportedException | The NodeCollection is a "deep" collection. |

## Remarks

The node is inserted as a child into the node object from which the collection was created.If the index is equal to or greater than Count, the node is added at the end of the collection.If the index is negative and its absolute value is greater than Count, the node is added at the end of the collection.

If the newChild is already in the tree, it is first removed.If the node being inserted was created from another document, you should use [`ImportNode`](../../documentbase/importnode) to import the node to the current document. The imported node can then be inserted into the current document.
