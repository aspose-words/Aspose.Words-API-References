## StyleCollection.DefaultFont property

Gets document default text formatting.

```csharp
public Font DefaultFont { get; }
```

### Remarks

Note that document-wide defaults were introduced in Microsoft Word 2007 and are fully supported in OOXML formats (Docx) only. Earlier document formats have limited support for this feature and only font names can be stored.
