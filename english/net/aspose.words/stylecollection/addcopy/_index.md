```csharp
public Style AddCopy(Style style)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| style | Style | Style to be copied. |

## Return Value

Copied style ready for usage.

### Remarks

Style to be copied can belong to the same document as well as to different document.

Linked style is copied.

This method does doesn't copy base styles.

If collection already contains a style with the same name, then new name is automatically generated by adding "_number" suffix starting from 0 e.g. "Normal_0", "Heading 1_1" etc. Use [`Name`](../../style/name) setter for changing the name of the imported style.
