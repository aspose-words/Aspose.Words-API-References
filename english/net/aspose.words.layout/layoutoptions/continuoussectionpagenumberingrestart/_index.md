## LayoutOptions.ContinuousSectionPageNumberingRestart property

Gets or sets the mode of behavior for computing page numbers when a continuous section restarts the page numbering.

```csharp
public ContinuousSectionRestart ContinuousSectionPageNumberingRestart { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

The default value is Always. It matches the behavior of MS Word 2019 which was the latest version at the moment the option was introduced. Older page numbering logic demonstrated by MS Word 2016 is available via this option. Please [`ContinuousSectionRestart`](../../continuoussectionrestart) for the behavior description.
