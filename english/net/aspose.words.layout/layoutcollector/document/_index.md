## LayoutCollector.Document property

Gets or sets the document this collector instance is attached to.

```csharp
public Document Document { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

If you need to access page indexes of the document nodes you need to set this property to point to a document instance, before page layout of the document is built. It is best to set this property to `null` afterwards, otherwise the collector continues to accumulate information from subsequent rebuilds of the document's page layout.
