## LayoutCollector.GetEntity method

Returns an opaque position of the [`LayoutEnumerator`](../../layoutenumerator) which corresponds to the specified node. You can use returned value as an argument to [`Current`](../../layoutenumerator/current) given the document being enumerated and the document of the node are the same.

```csharp
public object GetEntity(Node node)
```

## Remarks

This method works for only [`Paragraph`](../../../aspose.words/paragraph) nodes, as well as indivisible inline nodes, e.g. [`BookmarkStart`](../../../aspose.words/bookmarkstart) or [`Shape`](../../../aspose.words.drawing/shape). It doesn't work for [`Run`](../../../aspose.words/run), [`Cell`](../../../aspose.words.tables/cell)[`Row`](../../../aspose.words.tables/row) or [`Table`](../../../aspose.words.tables/table) nodes, and nodes within header/footer.

Note that the entity returned for a [`Paragraph`](../../../aspose.words/paragraph) node is a paragraph break span. Use the appropriate method to ascend to the parent line

If you need to navigate to a [`Run`](../../../aspose.words/run) of text then you can insert bookmark right before it and then navigate to the bookmark instead.

If you need to navigate to a [`Cell`](../../../aspose.words.tables/cell) node then you can move to a [`Paragraph`](../../../aspose.words/paragraph) node in this cell and then ascend to a parent entity. The same approach can be used for [`Row`](../../../aspose.words.tables/row) and [`Table`](../../../aspose.words.tables/table) nodes.
