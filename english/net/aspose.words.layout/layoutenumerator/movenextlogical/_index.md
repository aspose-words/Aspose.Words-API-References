## LayoutEnumerator.MoveNextLogical method

Moves to the next sibling entity in a logical order. When iterating lines of a paragraph broken across pages this method will move to the next line even if it resides on another page.

```csharp
public bool MoveNextLogical()
```

## Remarks

Note that all Span entities are linked together thus if [`Current`](../current) entity is span repeated calling of this method will iterates complete story of the document.
