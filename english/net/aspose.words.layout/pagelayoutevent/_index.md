## PageLayoutEvent enumeration

A code of event raised during page layout model build and rendering.

Page layout model is built in two steps. First, "conversion step", this is when page layout pulls document content and creates object graph. Second, "reflow step", this is when structures are split, merged and arranged into pages.

Depending of the operation which triggered build, page layout model may or may not be further rendered into fixed page format. For example, computing number of pages in the document or updating fields does not require rendering, whereas export to Pdf does.

```csharp
public enum PageLayoutEvent
```

| PartReflowStarted | `8` | Reflow of the page has started. Note that page may reflow multiple times and that reflow may restart before it is finished. |
| PartReflowFinished | `9` | Reflow of the page has finished. Note that page may reflow multiple times and that reflow may restart before it is finished. |
