## Remarks

OLE package is a legacy and "undocumented" way to store embedded object if OLE handler is unknown. Early Windows versions such as Windows 3.1, 95 and 98 had Packager.exe application which could be used to embed any type of data into document. Now this application is excluded from Windows but MS Word and other applications still use it to embed data if OLE handler is missing or unknown.
