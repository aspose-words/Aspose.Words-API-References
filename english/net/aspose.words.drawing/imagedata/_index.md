| [HasImage](../../aspose.words.drawing/imagedata/hasimage) { get; } | Returns true if the shape has image bytes or links an image. |
| [ImageBytes](../../aspose.words.drawing/imagedata/imagebytes) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the raw bytes of the image stored in the shape. |
| [ImageSize](../../aspose.words.drawing/imagedata/imagesize) { get; } | Gets the information about image size and resolution. |
| [ImageType](../../aspose.words.drawing/imagedata/imagetype) { get; } | Gets the type of the image. |
| [IsLink](../../aspose.words.drawing/imagedata/islink) { get; } | Returns true if the image is linked to the shape (when [`SourceFullName`](./sourcefullname) is specified). |

| [SourceFullName](../../aspose.words.drawing/imagedata/sourcefullname) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the path and name of the source file for the linked image. |

| --- | --- |
| [Save](../../aspose.words.drawing/imagedata/save)(Stream) | Saves the image into the specified stream. |
| [Save](../../aspose.words.drawing/imagedata/save)(string) | Saves the image into a file. |
| [SetImage](../../aspose.words.drawing/imagedata/setimage)(Image) | Sets the image that the shape displays. |
| [SetImage](../../aspose.words.drawing/imagedata/setimage)(Stream) | Sets the image that the shape displays. |
| [SetImage](../../aspose.words.drawing/imagedata/setimage)(string) | Sets the image that the shape displays. |
| [ToByteArray](../../aspose.words.drawing/imagedata/tobytearray)() | Returns image bytes for any image regardless whether the image is stored or linked. |
| [ToImage](../../aspose.words.drawing/imagedata/toimage)() | Gets the image stored in the shape as a Image object. |
| [ToStream](../../aspose.words.drawing/imagedata/tostream)() | Creates and returns a stream that contains the image bytes. |

### Remarks

Use the [`ImageData`](../shape/imagedata) property to access and modify the image inside a shape. You do not create instances of the [`ImageData`](../imagedata) class directly.

An image can be stored inside a shape, linked to external file or both (linked and stored in the document).

Regardless of whether the image is stored inside the shape or linked, you can always access the actual image using the [`ToByteArray`](./tobytearray), [`ToStream`](./tostream), [`ToImage`](./toimage) or [`Save`](./save) methods. If the image is stored inside the shape, you can also directly access it using the [`ImageBytes`](./imagebytes) property.

To store an image inside a shape use the [`SetImage`](./setimage) method. To link an image to a shape, set the [`SourceFullName`](./sourcefullname) property.
