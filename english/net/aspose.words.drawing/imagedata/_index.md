| --- | --- |
| [BiLevel](bilevel) { get; set; } | Determines whether an image will be displayed in black and white. |
| [Borders](borders) { get; } | Gets the collection of borders of the image. Borders only have effect for inline images. |
| [Brightness](brightness) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the brightness of the picture. The value for this property must be a number from 0.0 (dimmest) to 1.0 (brightest). |
| [ChromaKey](chromakey) { get; set; } | Defines the color value of the image that will be treated as transparent. |
| [Contrast](contrast) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the contrast for the specified picture. The value for this property must be a number from 0.0 (the least contrast) to 1.0 (the greatest contrast). |
| [CropBottom](cropbottom) { get; set; } | Defines the fraction of picture removal from the bottom side. |
| [CropLeft](cropleft) { get; set; } | Defines the fraction of picture removal from the left side. |
| [CropRight](cropright) { get; set; } | Defines the fraction of picture removal from the right side. |
| [CropTop](croptop) { get; set; } | Defines the fraction of picture removal from the top side. |
| [GrayScale](grayscale) { get; set; } | Determines whether a picture will display in grayscale mode. |
| [HasImage](hasimage) { get; } | Returns true if the shape has image bytes or links an image. |
| [ImageBytes](imagebytes) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the raw bytes of the image stored in the shape. |
| [ImageSize](imagesize) { get; } | Gets the information about image size and resolution. |
| [ImageType](imagetype) { get; } | Gets the type of the image. |
| [IsLink](islink) { get; } | Returns true if the image is linked to the shape (when [`SourceFullName`](./sourcefullname) is specified). |
| [IsLinkOnly](islinkonly) { get; } | Returns true if the image is linked and not stored in the document. |
| [SourceFullName](sourcefullname) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the path and name of the source file for the linked image. |

| [SetImage](setimage)(…) |  (3 methods) |
| [ToByteArray](tobytearray)() | Returns image bytes for any image regardless whether the image is stored or linked. |
| [ToImage](toimage)() | Gets the image stored in the shape as a Image object. |
| [ToStream](tostream)() | Creates and returns a stream that contains the image bytes. |

## Remarks

Use the [`ImageData`](../shape/imagedata) property to access and modify the image inside a shape. You do not create instances of the [`ImageData`](../imagedata) class directly.An image can be stored inside a shape, linked to external file or both (linked and stored in the document).Regardless of whether the image is stored inside the shape or linked, you can always access the actual image using the [`ToByteArray`](./tobytearray), [`ToStream`](./tostream), [`ToImage`](./toimage) or [`Save`](./save) methods. If the image is stored inside the shape, you can also directly access it using the [`ImageBytes`](./imagebytes) property.To store an image inside a shape use the [`SetImage`](./setimage) method. To link an image to a shape, set the [`SourceFullName`](./sourcefullname) property.
