## ImageData.ToStream method

Creates and returns a stream that contains the image bytes.

```csharp
public Stream ToStream()
```

### Remarks

If the image bytes are stored in the shape, creates and returns a MemoryStream object.

If the image is linked and stored in a file, opens the file and returns a FileStream object.

If the image is linked and stored in an external URL, downloads the file and returns a MemoryStream object.

Is it the responsibility of the caller to dispose the stream object.
