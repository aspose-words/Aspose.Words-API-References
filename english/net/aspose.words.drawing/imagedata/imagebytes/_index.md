## ImageData.ImageBytes property

Gets or sets the raw bytes of the image stored in the shape.

```csharp
public byte[] ImageBytes { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

Setting the value to `null` or an empty array will remove the image from the shape.

Returns `null` if the image is not stored in the document (e.g the image is probably linked in this case).
