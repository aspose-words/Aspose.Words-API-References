## ShapeBase.AspectRatioLocked property

Specifies whether the shape's aspect ratio is locked.

```csharp
public bool AspectRatioLocked { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

The default value depends on the [`ShapeType`](../shapetype), for the ShapeType.Image it is **true** but for the other shape types it is **false**.

Has effect for top level shapes only.
