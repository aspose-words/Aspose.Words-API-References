## ShapeBase.CanHaveImage property

Returns true if the shape type allows the shape to have an image.

```csharp
public bool CanHaveImage { get; }
```

## Remarks

Although Microsoft Word has a special shape type for images, it appears that in Microsoft Word documents any shape except a group shape can have an image, therefore this property returns true for all shapes except [`GroupShape`](../../groupshape).
