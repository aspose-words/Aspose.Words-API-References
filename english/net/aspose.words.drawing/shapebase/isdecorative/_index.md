Shows how to set that the shape is decorative.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Decorative shapes.docx");

Shape shape = (Shape) doc.GetChildNodes(NodeType.Shape, true)[0];
Assert.True(shape.IsDecorative);

// If "AlternativeText" is not empty, the shape cannot be decorative.
// That's why our value has changed to 'false'.
shape.AlternativeText = "Alternative text.";
Assert.False(shape.IsDecorative);

DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

builder.MoveToDocumentEnd();
// Create a new shape as decorative.
