## ShapeBase.ZOrder property

Determines the display order of overlapping shapes.

```csharp
public int ZOrder { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Has effect only for top level shapes.

The default value is 0.

The number represents the stacking precedence. A shape with a higher number will be displayed as if it were overlapping (in "front" of) a shape with a lower number.

The order of overlapping shapes is independent for shapes in the header and in the main text of the document.

The display order of child shapes in a group shape is determined by their order inside the group shape.
