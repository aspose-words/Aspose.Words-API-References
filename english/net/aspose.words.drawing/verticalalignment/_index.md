## VerticalAlignment enumeration

Specifies vertical alignment of a floating shape, text frame or a floating table.

public enum VerticalAlignment
```

## Values

| name | value | description |

| None | `0` | The object is explicitly positioned, usually using its Top property. |
| Top | `1` | Specifies that the object shall be at the top of the vertical alignment base. |
| Center | `2` | Specifies that the object shall be centered with respect to the vertical alignment base. |
| Bottom | `3` | Specifies that the object shall be at the bottom of the vertical alignment base. |
| Inside | `4` | Specifies that the object shall be inside of the horizontal alignment base. |
