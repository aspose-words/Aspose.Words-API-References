## Shape.UpdateSmartArtDrawing method

Updates SmartArt pre-rendered drawing by using Aspose.Words's SmartArt cold rendering engine.

```csharp
public void UpdateSmartArtDrawing()
```

### Remarks

Microsoft Word generates and saves the pre-rendered drawing along with SmartArt object. However, if the document is saved by other applications, the pre-rendered SmartArt drawing may be missing or incorrect. If pre-rendered drawing is available then Aspose.Words uses it to render the SmartArt object. If pre-rendered drawing is missing then Aspose.Words uses its own SmartArt cold rendering engine to render the SmartArt object. If pre-rendered drawing is incorrect then it is required to call this method to invoke the SmartArt cold rendering engine.
