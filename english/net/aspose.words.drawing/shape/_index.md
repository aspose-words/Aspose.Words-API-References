## Remarks

Using the [`Shape`](../shape) class you can create or modify shapes in a Microsoft Word document.An important property of a shape is its [`ShapeType`](../shapebase/shapetype). Shapes of different types can have different capabilities in a Word document. For example, only image and OLE shapes can have images inside them. Most of the shapes can have text, but not all.Shapes that can have text, can contain [`Paragraph`](../../aspose.words/paragraph) and [`Table`](../../aspose.words.tables/table) nodes as children.
