## Shape.Accept method

Accepts a visitor.

```csharp
public override bool Accept(DocumentVisitor visitor)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| visitor | The visitor that will visit the nodes. |

## Return Value

True if all nodes were visited; false if DocumentVisitor stopped the operation before visiting all nodes.

## Remarks

Enumerates over this node and all of its children. Each node calls a corresponding method on DocumentVisitor.For more info see the Visitor design pattern.

Calls [`VisitShapeStart`](../../../aspose.words/documentvisitor/visitshapestart), then calls [`Accept`](../../../aspose.words/node/accept) for all child nodes of the shape and calls [`VisitShapeEnd`](../../../aspose.words/documentvisitor/visitshapeend) at the end.
