## OleFormat.SourceItem property

Gets or sets a string that is used to identify the portion of the source file that is being linked.

```csharp
public string SourceItem { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

The default value is an empty string.

For example, if the source file is a Microsoft Excel workbook, the `SourceItem` property might return "Workbook1!R3C1:R4C2" if the OLE object contains only a few cells from the worksheet.
