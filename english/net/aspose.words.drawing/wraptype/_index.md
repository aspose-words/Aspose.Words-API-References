## WrapType enumeration

Specifies how text is wrapped around a shape or picture.

```csharp
public enum WrapType
```

## Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | `3` | No text wrapping around the shape. The shape is placed behind or in front of text. |
| Inline | `0` | The shape remains on the same layer as text and treated as a character. |
| TopBottom | `1` | The text stops at the top of the shape and restarts on the line below the shape. |
| Square | `2` | Wraps text around all sides of the square bounding box of the shape. |
| Tight | `4` | Wraps tightly around the edges of the shape, instead of wrapping around the bounding box. |
| Through | `5` | Same as Tight, but wraps inside any parts of the shape that are open. |
