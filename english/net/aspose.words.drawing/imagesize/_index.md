## ImageSize class

Contains information about image size and resolution.

```csharp
public class ImageSize
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ImageSize](imagesize)(int, int) | Initializes width and height to the given values in pixels. Initializes resolution to 96 dpi. |
| [ImageSize](imagesize)(int, int, double, double) | Initializes width, height and resolution to the given values. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [HeightPixels](heightpixels) { get; } | Gets the height of the image in pixels. |
| [HeightPoints](heightpoints) { get; } | Gets the height of the image in points. 1 point is 1/72 inch. |
| [HorizontalResolution](horizontalresolution) { get; } | Gets the horizontal resolution in DPI. |
| [VerticalResolution](verticalresolution) { get; } | Gets the vertical resolution in DPI. |
| [WidthPixels](widthpixels) { get; } | Gets the width of the image in pixels. |
| [WidthPoints](widthpoints) { get; } | Gets the width of the image in points. 1 point is 1/72 inch. |

### Examples

Shows how to resize a shape with an image.

```csharp
#if NET48 || JAVA
            Image image = Image.FromFile(ImageDir + "Logo.jpg");

            Assert.AreEqual(400, image.Size.Width);
            Assert.AreEqual(400, image.Size.Height);
#elif NET5_0
            SKBitmap image = SKBitmap.Decode(ImageDir + "Logo.jpg");

            Assert.AreEqual(400, image.Width);
            Assert.AreEqual(400, image.Height);
#endif

            // When we insert an image using the "InsertImage" method, the builder scales the shape that displays the image so that,
            // when we view the document using 100% zoom in Microsoft Word, the shape displays the image in its actual size.
            Document doc = new Document();
            DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);
            Shape shape = builder.InsertImage(ImageDir + "Logo.jpg");

            // A 400x400 image will create an ImageData object with an image size of 300x300pt.
            ImageSize imageSize = shape.ImageData.ImageSize;

            Assert.AreEqual(300.0d, imageSize.WidthPoints);
            Assert.AreEqual(300.0d, imageSize.HeightPoints);

            // If a shape's dimensions match the image data's dimensions,
            // then the shape is displaying the image in its original size.
            Assert.AreEqual(300.0d, shape.Width);
            Assert.AreEqual(300.0d, shape.Height);

            // Reduce the overall size of the shape by 50%. 
            shape.Width *= 0.5;

            // Scaling factors apply to both the width and the height at the same time to preserve the shape's proportions. 
            Assert.AreEqual(150.0d, shape.Width);
            Assert.AreEqual(150.0d, shape.Height);

            // When we resize the shape, the size of the image data remains the same.
            Assert.AreEqual(300.0d, imageSize.WidthPoints);
            Assert.AreEqual(300.0d, imageSize.HeightPoints);

            // We can reference the image data dimensions to apply a scaling based on the size of the image.
            shape.Width = imageSize.WidthPoints * 1.1;

            Assert.AreEqual(330.0d, shape.Width);
            Assert.AreEqual(330.0d, shape.Height);

            doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "Image.ScaleImage.docx");
```
