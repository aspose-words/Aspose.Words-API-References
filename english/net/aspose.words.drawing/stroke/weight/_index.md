Shape shape = builder.InsertShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, RelativeHorizontalPosition.LeftMargin, 100,
    RelativeVerticalPosition.TopMargin, 100, 200, 200, WrapType.None);

// Basic shapes, such as the rectangle, have two visible parts.

shape.Fill.ForeColor = Color.White;

// Modify various properties of this shape's stroke.
Stroke stroke = shape.Stroke;
