| [EndArrowLength](../../aspose.words.drawing/stroke/endarrowlength/) { get; set; } | Defines the arrowhead length for the end of a stroke. |
| [EndArrowType](../../aspose.words.drawing/stroke/endarrowtype/) { get; set; } | Defines the arrowhead for the end of a stroke. |
| [EndArrowWidth](../../aspose.words.drawing/stroke/endarrowwidth/) { get; set; } | Defines the arrowhead width for the end of a stroke. |
| [EndCap](../../aspose.words.drawing/stroke/endcap/) { get; set; } | Defines the cap style for the end of a stroke. |

| [StartArrowType](../../aspose.words.drawing/stroke/startarrowtype/) { get; set; } | Defines the arrowhead for the start of a stroke. |
| [StartArrowWidth](../../aspose.words.drawing/stroke/startarrowwidth/) { get; set; } | Defines the arrowhead width for the start of a stroke. |
| [Transparency](../../aspose.words.drawing/stroke/transparency/) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a value between 0.0 (opaque) and 1.0 (clear) representing the degree of transparency of the stroke. |

## Remarks

Use the [`Stroke`](../shape/stroke/) property to access stroke properties of a shape. You do not create instances of the `Stroke` class directly.

## Examples

Shows how change stroke properties.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

Shape shape = builder.InsertShape(ShapeType.Rectangle, RelativeHorizontalPosition.LeftMargin, 100,
    RelativeVerticalPosition.TopMargin, 100, 200, 200, WrapType.None);

// Basic shapes, such as the rectangle, have two visible parts.
// 1 -  The fill, which applies to the area within the outline of the shape:
shape.Fill.ForeColor = Color.White;

// 2 -  The stroke, which marks the outline of the shape:
// Modify various properties of this shape's stroke.
Stroke stroke = shape.Stroke;
stroke.On = true;
stroke.Weight = 5;
stroke.Color = Color.Red;
stroke.DashStyle = DashStyle.ShortDashDotDot;
stroke.JoinStyle = JoinStyle.Miter;
stroke.EndCap = EndCap.Square;
stroke.LineStyle = ShapeLineStyle.Triple;
