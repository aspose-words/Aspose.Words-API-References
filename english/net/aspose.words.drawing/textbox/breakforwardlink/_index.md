## TextBox.BreakForwardLink method

Breaks the link to the next TextBox.

```csharp
public void BreakForwardLink()
```

### Remarks

BreakForwardLink() doesn't break all other links in the current sequence of shapes. For example: 1-2-3-4 sequence and BreakForwardLink at the 2-nd textbox will create two sequences 1-2, 3-4.
