### Remarks

A [`GroupShape`](../groupshape) is a composite node and can have [`Shape`](../shape) and [`GroupShape`](../groupshape) nodes as children.

Each [`GroupShape`](../groupshape) defines a new coordinate system for its child shapes. The coordinate system is defined using the [`CoordSize`](../shapebase/coordsize) and [`CoordOrigin`](../shapebase/coordorigin) properties.
