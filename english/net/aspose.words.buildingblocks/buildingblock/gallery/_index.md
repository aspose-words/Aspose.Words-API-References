## BuildingBlock.Gallery property

Specifies the first-level categorization for the building block for the purposes of classification or user interface sorting.

```csharp
public BuildingBlockGallery Gallery { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

Building blocks in Microsoft Word user interface are arranged into Galleries. Each `Gallery` can have multiple Categories. Each block within a [`Category`](../category) has a [`Name`](../name).

Corresponds to the docPartPr.category.gallery element in OOXML.
