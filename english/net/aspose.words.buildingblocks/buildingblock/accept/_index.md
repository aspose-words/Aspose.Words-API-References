## BuildingBlock.Accept method

Accepts a visitor.

```csharp
public override bool Accept(DocumentVisitor visitor)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| visitor | DocumentVisitor | The visitor that will visit the nodes. |

## Return Value

True if all nodes were visited; false if DocumentVisitor stopped the operation before visiting all nodes.

### Remarks

Enumerates over this node and all of its children. Each node calls a corresponding method on DocumentVisitor.

For more info see the Visitor design pattern.

Calls [`VisitBuildingBlockStart`](../../../aspose.words/documentvisitor/visitbuildingblockstart), then calls [`Accept`](../../../aspose.words/node/accept) for all child nodes of this building block, then calls [`VisitBuildingBlockEnd`](../../../aspose.words/documentvisitor/visitbuildingblockend).

Note: A building block node and its children are not visited when you execute a Visitor over a [`Document`](../../../aspose.words/document). If you want to execute a Visitor over a building block, you need to execute the visitor over [`GlossaryDocument`](../../glossarydocument) or call `Accept`.
