## BuildingBlock.Guid property

Gets or sets an identifier (a 128-bit GUID) that uniquely identifies this building block.

```csharp
public Guid Guid { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

Can be used by an application to uniquely reference a building block regardless of different naming due to localization.

Corresponds to the docPartPr.guid element in OOXML.
