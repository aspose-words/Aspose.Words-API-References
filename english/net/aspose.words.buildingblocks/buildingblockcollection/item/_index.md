## BuildingBlockCollection indexer

Retrieves a building block at the given index.

```csharp
public BuildingBlock this[int index] { get; }
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| index | An index into the list of building blocks. |

### Remarks

The index is zero-based.

Negative indexes are allowed and indicate access from the back of the collection. For example -1 means the last item, -2 means the second before last and so on.

If index is greater than or equal to the number of items in the list, this returns a null reference.

If index is negative and its absolute value is greater than the number of items in the list, this returns a null reference.
