### Remarks

Some documents, usually templates, can contain AutoText, AutoCorrect entries and/or Building Blocks (also known as glossary document entries, document parts or building blocks).

To access building blocks, you need to load a document into a [`Document`](../../aspose.words/document) object. Building blocks will be available via the [`GlossaryDocument`](../../aspose.words/document/glossarydocument) property.

[`GlossaryDocument`](../glossarydocument) can contain any number of [`BuildingBlock`](../buildingblock) objects. Each [`BuildingBlock`](../buildingblock) represents one document part.

Corresponds to the **glossaryDocument** and **docParts** elements in OOXML.
