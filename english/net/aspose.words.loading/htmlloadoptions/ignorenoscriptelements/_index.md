## HtmlLoadOptions.IgnoreNoscriptElements property

Gets or sets a value indicating whether to ignore &lt;noscript&gt; HTML elements. Default value is `false`.

```csharp
public bool IgnoreNoscriptElements { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Like MS Word, Aspose.Words does not support scripts and by default loads content of &lt;noscript&gt; elements into the resulting document. In most browsers, however, scripts are supported and content from &lt;noscript&gt; is not visible. Setting this property to `true` forces Aspose.Words to ignore all &lt;noscript&gt; elements and helps to produce documents that look closer to what is seen in browsers.
