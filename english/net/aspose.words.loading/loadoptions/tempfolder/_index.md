## LoadOptions.TempFolder property

Allows to use temporary files when reading document. By default this property is `null` and no temporary files are used.

```csharp
public string TempFolder { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

The folder must exist and be writable, otherwise an exception will be thrown.

Aspose.Words automatically deletes all temporary files when reading is complete.
