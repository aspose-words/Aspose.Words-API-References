## LoadOptions.LoadFormat property

Specifies the format of the document to be loaded. Default is Auto.

```csharp
public LoadFormat LoadFormat { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

It is recommended that you specify the Auto value and let Aspose.Words detect the file format automatically. If you know the format of the document you are about to load, you can specify the format explicitly and this will slightly reduce the loading time by the overhead associated with auto detecting the format. If you specify an explicit load format and it will turn out to be wrong, the auto detection will be invoked and a second attempt to load the file will be made.
