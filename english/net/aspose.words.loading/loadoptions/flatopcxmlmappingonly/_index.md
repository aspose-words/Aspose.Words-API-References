## LoadOptions.FlatOpcXmlMappingOnly property

Gets or sets value determining which document formats are allowed to be mapped by [`XmlMapping`](../../../aspose.words.markup/structureddocumenttag/xmlmapping). By default only FlatOpc document format is allowed to be mapped.

```csharp
public bool FlatOpcXmlMappingOnly { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

This option is paired with [`FlatOpcXmlMappingOnly`](../../../aspose.words.saving/saveoptions/flatopcxmlmappingonly). Typically you need set both of them to false to allow arbitrary document format mapped.
