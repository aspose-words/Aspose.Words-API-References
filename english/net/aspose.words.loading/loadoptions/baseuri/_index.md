## LoadOptions.BaseUri property

Gets or sets the string that will be used to resolve relative URIs found in the document into absolute URIs when required. Can be null or empty string. Default is null.

```csharp
public string BaseUri { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

This property is used to resolve relative URIs into absolute in the following cases:

1. When loading an HTML document from a stream and the document contains images with relative URIs and does not have a base URI specified in the BASE HTML element.
2. When saving a document to PDF and other formats, to retrieve images linked using relative URIs so the images can be saved into the output document.
