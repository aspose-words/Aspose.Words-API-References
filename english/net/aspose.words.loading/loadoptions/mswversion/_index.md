## LoadOptions.MswVersion property

Allows to specify that the document loading process should match a specific MS Word version. Default value is Word2019

```csharp
public MsWordVersion MswVersion { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Different Word versions may handle certain aspects of document content and formatting slightly differently during the loading process, which may result in minor differences in Document Object Model.

### Examples

Shows how to emulate the loading procedure of a specific Microsoft Word version during document loading.

```csharp
// By default, Aspose.Words load documents according to Microsoft Word 2019 specification.
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions();

Assert.AreEqual(MsWordVersion.Word2019, loadOptions.MswVersion);

// This document is missing the default paragraph formatting style.
// This default style will be regenerated when we load the document either with Microsoft Word or Aspose.Words.
loadOptions.MswVersion = MsWordVersion.Word2007;
Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Document.docx", loadOptions);

// The style's line spacing will have this value when loaded by Microsoft Word 2007 specification.
Assert.AreEqual(12.95d, doc.Styles.DefaultParagraphFormat.LineSpacing, 0.01d);
```
