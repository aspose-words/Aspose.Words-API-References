## LoadOptions.MswVersion property

Allows to specify that the document loading process should match a specific MS Word version. Default value is Word2019

```csharp
public MsWordVersion MswVersion { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

Different Word versions may handle certain aspects of document content and formatting slightly differently during the loading process, which may result in minor differences in Document Object Model.
