## LanguagePreferences.AddEditingLanguage method

Adds additional editing language.

public void AddEditingLanguage(EditingLanguage language)
```

### Examples

Shows how to apply language preferences when loading a document.

```csharp
LoadOptions loadOptions = new LoadOptions();
loadOptions.LanguagePreferences.AddEditingLanguage(EditingLanguage.Japanese);

Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "No default editing language.docx", loadOptions);

int localeIdFarEast = doc.Styles.DefaultFont.LocaleIdFarEast;
Console.WriteLine(localeIdFarEast == (int)EditingLanguage.Japanese
    ? "The document either has no any FarEast language set in defaults or it was set to Japanese originally."
    : "The document default FarEast language was set to another than Japanese language originally, so it is not overridden.");
```
