## ChmLoadOptions.OriginalFileName property

The name of the CHM file. Default value is `null`.

```csharp
public string OriginalFileName { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

CHM documents may contain links that reference the same document by file name. Aspose.Words supports such links and normally uses [`OriginalFileName`](../../../aspose.words/document/originalfilename) to check whether the file referenced by a link is the file that is being loaded. If a document is loaded from a stream, its original file name should be specified explicitly via this property, since it cannot be determined automatically.

If a CHM document is loaded from a file and a non-null value for this property is specified, the value will take priority over the actual name of the file stored in [`OriginalFileName`](../../../aspose.words/document/originalfilename).
