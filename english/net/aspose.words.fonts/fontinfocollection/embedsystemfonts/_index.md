## FontInfoCollection.EmbedSystemFonts property

Specifies whether or not to embed System fonts into the document. Default value for this property is **false**.

This option works only when [`EmbedTrueTypeFonts`](../embedtruetypefonts) option is set to **true**.

```csharp
public bool EmbedSystemFonts { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Setting this property to `True` is useful if the user is on an East Asian system and wants to create a document that is readable by others who do not have fonts for that language on their system. For example, a user on a Japanese system could choose to embed the fonts in a document so that the Japanese document would be readable on all systems.

This option works for DOC, DOCX and RTF formats only.
