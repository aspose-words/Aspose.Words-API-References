## Remarks

Aspose.Words uses font settings to resolve the fonts in the document. Fonts are resolved mostly when building document layout or rendering to fixed page formats. But when loading some formats, Aspose.Words also may require to resolve the fonts. For example, when loading HTML documents Aspose.Words may resolve the fonts to perform font fallback. So it is recommended that you set the font settings in [`LoadOptions`](../../aspose.words.loading/loadoptions) when loading the document. Or at least before building the layout or rendering the document to the fixed-page format.

By default all documents uses single static font settings instance. It could be accessed by [`DefaultInstance`](./defaultinstance) property.

Changing font settings is safe at any time from any thread. But it is recommended that you do not change the font settings while processing some documents which uses this settings. This can lead to the fact that the same font will be resolved differently in different parts of the document.
