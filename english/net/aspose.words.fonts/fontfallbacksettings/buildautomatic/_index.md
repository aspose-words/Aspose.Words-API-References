## FontFallbackSettings.BuildAutomatic method

Automatically builds the fallback settings by scanning available fonts.

```csharp
public void BuildAutomatic()
```

## Remarks

This method may produce non-optimal fallback settings. Fonts are checked by [ Unicode Character Range](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#ur) fields and not by the actual glyphs presence. Also Unicode ranges are checked individually and several ranges related to single language/script may use different fallback fonts.
