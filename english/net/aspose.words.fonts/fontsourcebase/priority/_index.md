## FontSourceBase.Priority property

Returns the font source priority.

```csharp
public int Priority { get; }
```

## Remarks

This value is used when there are fonts with the same family name and style in different font sources. In this case Aspose.Words selects the font from the source with the higher priority value.

The default value is 0.
