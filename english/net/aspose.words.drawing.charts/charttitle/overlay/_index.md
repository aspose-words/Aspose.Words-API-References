## ChartTitle.Overlay property

Determines whether other chart elements shall be allowed to overlap title. By default overlay is false.

```csharp
public bool Overlay { get; set; }
```

### Examples

Shows how to insert a chart and set a title.

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
DocumentBuilder builder = new DocumentBuilder(doc);

// Insert a chart shape with a document builder and get its chart.
Shape chartShape = builder.InsertChart(ChartType.Bar, 400, 300);
Chart chart = chartShape.Chart;

// Use the "Title" property to give our chart a title, which appears at the top center of the chart area.
ChartTitle title = chart.Title;
title.Text = "My Chart";

// Set the "Show" property to "true" to make the title visible. 
title.Show = true;

// Set the "Overlay" property to "true" Give other chart elements more room by allowing them to overlap the title
title.Overlay = true;

doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "Charts.ChartTitle.docx");
```
