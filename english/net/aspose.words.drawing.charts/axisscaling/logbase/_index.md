## AxisScaling.LogBase property

Gets or sets the logarithmic base for a logarithmic axis.

```csharp
public double LogBase { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

The property is not supported by MS Office 2016 new charts.

Valid range of a floating point value is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 1000. The property has effect only if [`Type`](../type) is set to Logarithmic.

Setting this property sets the [`Type`](../type) property to Logarithmic.
