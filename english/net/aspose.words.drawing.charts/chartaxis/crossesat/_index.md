## ChartAxis.CrossesAt property

Specifies where on the perpendicular axis the axis crosses.

```csharp
public double CrossesAt { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

The property has effect only if [`Crosses`](../crosses) are set to Custom. It is not supported by MS Office 2016 new charts.

The units are determined by the type of axis. When the axis is a value axis, the value of the property is a decimal number on the value axis. When the axis is a time category axis, the value is defined as an integer number of days relative to the base date (30/12/1899). For a text category axis, the value is an integer category number, starting with 1 as the first category.
