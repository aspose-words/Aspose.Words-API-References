## BuiltInDocumentProperties indexer

Returns a [`DocumentProperty`](../../documentproperty) object by the name of the property.

```csharp
public override DocumentProperty this[string name] { get; }
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| name | The case-insensitive name of the property to retrieve. |

## Remarks

The string names of the properties correspond to the names of the typed properties available from [`BuiltInDocumentProperties`](../../builtindocumentproperties).

If you request a property that is not present in the document, but the name of the property is recognized as a valid built-in name, a new [`DocumentProperty`](../../documentproperty) is created, added to the collection and returned. The newly created property is assigned a default value (empty string, zero, false or DateTime.MinValue depending on the type of the built-in property).

If you request a property that is not present in the document and the name is not recognized as a built-in name, a null is returned.
