## BuiltInDocumentProperties.Security property

Specifies the security level of a document as a numeric value.

```csharp
public DocumentSecurity Security { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

Use this property for informational purposes only because Microsoft Word does not always set this property. This property is available in DOC and OOXML documents only.

To protect or unprotect a document use the [`Protect`](../../../aspose.words/document/protect) and [`Unprotect`](../../../aspose.words/document/unprotect) methods.

Aspose.Words updates this property to a correct value before saving a document.
