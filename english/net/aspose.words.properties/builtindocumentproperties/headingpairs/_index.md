## BuiltInDocumentProperties.HeadingPairs property

Specifies document headings and their names.

```csharp
public object[] HeadingPairs { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Every heading pair occupies two elements in this array.

The first element of the pair is a String and specifies the heading name. The second element of the pair is an Int32 and specifies the count of document parts for this heading in the [`TitlesOfParts`](../titlesofparts) property.

The total sum of counts for all heading pairs in this property must be equal to the number of elements in the [`TitlesOfParts`](../titlesofparts) property.

Aspose.Words does not update this property.
