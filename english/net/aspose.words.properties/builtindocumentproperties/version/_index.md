## BuiltInDocumentProperties.Version property

Represents the version number of the application that created the document.

```csharp
public int Version { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

When a document was created by Microsoft Word, then high 16 bit represent the major version and low 16 bit represent the build number.

### Examples

Shows how to work with document properties in the "Origin" category.

```csharp
// Open a document that we have created and edited using Microsoft Word.
Document doc = new Document(MyDir + "Properties.docx");
BuiltInDocumentProperties properties = doc.BuiltInDocumentProperties;

// The following built-in properties contain information regarding the creation and editing of this document.
// We can right-click this document in Windows Explorer and find
// these properties via "Properties" -> "Details" -> "Origin" category.
// Fields such as PRINTDATE and EDITTIME can display these values in the document body.
Console.WriteLine($"Created using {properties.NameOfApplication}, on {properties.CreatedTime}");
Console.WriteLine($"Minutes spent editing: {properties.TotalEditingTime}");
Console.WriteLine($"Date/time last printed: {properties.LastPrinted}");
Console.WriteLine($"Template document: {properties.Template}");

// We can also change the values of built-in properties.
properties.Company = "Doe Ltd.";
properties.Manager = "Jane Doe";
properties.Version = 5;
properties.RevisionNumber++;

// Microsoft Word updates the following properties automatically when we save the document.
// To use these properties with Aspose.Words, we will need to set values for them manually.
properties.LastSavedBy = "John Doe";
properties.LastSavedTime = DateTime.Now;

// We can right-click this document in Windows Explorer and find these properties in "Properties" -> "Details" -> "Origin".
doc.Save(ArtifactsDir + "DocumentProperties.Origin.docx");
```
