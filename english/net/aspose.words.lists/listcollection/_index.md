### Remarks

A list in a Microsoft Word document is a set of list formatting properties. The formatting of the lists is stored in the [`ListCollection`](../listcollection) collection separately from the paragraphs of text.

You do not create objects of this class. There is always only one [`ListCollection`](../listcollection) object per document and it is accessible via the [`Lists`](../../aspose.words/documentbase/lists) property.

To create a new list based on a predefined list template or based on a list style, use the [`Add`](./add) method.

To create a new list with formatting identical to an existing list, use the [`AddCopy`](./addcopy) method.

To make a paragraph bulleted or numbered, you need to apply list formatting to a paragraph by assigning a [`List`](../list) object to the [`List`](../listformat/list) property of [`ListFormat`](../listformat).

To remove list formatting from a paragraph, use the [`RemoveNumbers`](../listformat/removenumbers) method.

If you know a bit about WordprocessingML, then you might know it defines separate concepts for "list" and "list definition". This exactly corresponds to how list formatting is stored in a Microsoft Word document at the low level. List definition is like a "schema" and list is like an instance of a list definition.

To simplify programming model, Aspose.Words hides the distinction between list and list definition in much the same way like Microsoft Word hides this in its user interface. This allows you to concentrate more on how you want your document to look like, rather than building low-level objects to satisfy requirements of the Microsoft Word file format.

It is not possible to delete lists once they are created in the current version of Aspose.Words. This is similar to Microsoft Word where user does not have explicit control over list definitions.
