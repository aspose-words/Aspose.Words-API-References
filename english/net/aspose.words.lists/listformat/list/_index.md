## ListFormat.List property

Gets or sets the list this paragraph is a member of.

```csharp
public List List { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

The list that is being assigned to this property must belong to the current document.

The list that is being assigned to this property must not be a list style definition.

Setting this property to null removes bullets and numbering from the paragraph and sets the list level number to zero. Setting this property to null is equivalent to calling [`RemoveNumbers`](../removenumbers).
