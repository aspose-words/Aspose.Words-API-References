## Remarks

A paragraph in a Microsoft Word document can be bulleted or numbered. When a paragraph is bulleted or numbered, it is said that list formatting is applied to the paragraph.You do not create objects of the [`ListFormat`](../listformat) class directly. You access [`ListFormat`](../listformat) as a property of another object that can have list formatting associated with it. At the moment the objects that can have list formatting are: [`Paragraph`](../../aspose.words/paragraph), [`Style`](../../aspose.words/style) and [`DocumentBuilder`](../../aspose.words/documentbuilder).[`ListFormat`](../listformat) of a [`Paragraph`](../../aspose.words/paragraph) specifies what list formatting and list level is applied to that particular paragraph.[`ListFormat`](../listformat) of a [`Style`](../../aspose.words/style) (applicable to paragraph styles only) allows to specify what list formatting and list level is applied to all paragraphs of that particular style.[`ListFormat`](../listformat) of a [`DocumentBuilder`](../../aspose.words/documentbuilder) provides access to the list formatting at the current cursor position inside the [`DocumentBuilder`](../../aspose.words/documentbuilder).The list formatting itself is stored inside a [`List`](../list) object that is stored separately from the paragraphs. The list objects are stored inside a [`ListCollection`](../listcollection) collection. There is a single [`ListCollection`](../listcollection) collection per [`Document`](../../aspose.words/document).The paragraphs do not physically belong to a list. The paragraphs just reference a particular list object via the [`List`](./list) property and a particular level in the list via the [`ListLevelNumber`](./listlevelnumber) property. By setting these two properties you control what bullets and numbering is applied to a paragraph.
