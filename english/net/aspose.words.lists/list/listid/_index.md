## List.ListId property

Gets the unique identifier of the list.

```csharp
public int ListId { get; }
```

### Remarks

You do not normally need to use this property. But if you use it, you normally do so in conjunction with the [`GetListByListId`](../../listcollection/getlistbylistid) method to find a list by its identifier.
