## List.IsMultiLevel property

public bool IsMultiLevel { get; }
```

## Remarks

The lists that you create with Aspose.Words are always multi-level lists and contain 9 levels.Microsoft Word 2003 and later always create multi-level lists with 9 levels. But in some documents, created with earlier versions of Microsoft Word you might encounter lists that have 1 level only.
