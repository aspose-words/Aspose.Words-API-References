## BuildingBlock::get_Guid method


Gets or sets an identifier (a 128-bit GUID) that uniquely identifies this building block.

```cpp
System::Guid Aspose::Words::BuildingBlocks::BuildingBlock::get_Guid() const
```

## Remarks


Can be used by an application to uniquely reference a building block regardless of different naming due to localization.

Corresponds to the **docPartPr.guid** element in OOXML.
