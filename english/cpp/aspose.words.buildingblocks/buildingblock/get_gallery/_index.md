## BuildingBlock::get_Gallery method


Specifies the first-level categorization for the building block for the purposes of classification or user interface sorting.

```cpp
Aspose::Words::BuildingBlocks::BuildingBlockGallery Aspose::Words::BuildingBlocks::BuildingBlock::get_Gallery() const
```

## Remarks


Building blocks in Microsoft Word user interface are arranged into Galleries. Each [Gallery](./) can have multiple Categories. Each block within a [Category](../get_category/) has a [Name](../get_name/).

Corresponds to the **docPartPr.category.gallery** element in OOXML.
