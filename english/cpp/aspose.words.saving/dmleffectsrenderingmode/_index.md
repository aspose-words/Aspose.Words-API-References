enum class DmlEffectsRenderingMode
```

### Values

| --- | --- | --- |
| Simplified | 0 | [Rendering](../../aspose.words.rendering/) of DrawingML effects are simplified. |
| None | 1 | No DrawingML effects are rendered. |
| Fine | 2 | DrawingML effects are rendered in fine mode which involves advanced processing. In this mode rendering of effects gives better results but at a higher performance cost than [Simplified](./) mode. |
