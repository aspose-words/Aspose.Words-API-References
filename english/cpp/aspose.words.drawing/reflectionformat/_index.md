## ReflectionFormat class


Represents the reflection formatting for an object.

```cpp
class ReflectionFormat : public System::Object
```

## Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [get_Blur](./get_blur/)() | Gets a double value that specifies the degree of blur effect applied to the reflection effect in points. The default value is 0.0. |
| [get_Distance](./get_distance/)() | Gets a double value that specifies the amount of separation of the reflected image from the object in points. The default value is 0.0. |
| [get_Size](./get_size/)() | Gets a double value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the size of the reflection as a percentage of the reflected object. The default value is 0.0. |
| [get_Transparency](./get_transparency/)() | Gets a double value between 0.0 (opaque) and 1.0 (clear) representing the degree of transparency for the reflection effect. The default value is 0.0. |
| [GetType](./gettype/)() const override |  |
| [Is](./is/)(const System::TypeInfo\&) const override |  |
| [Remove](./remove/)() | Removes [ReflectionFormat](./) from the parent object. |
| [set_Blur](./set_blur/)(double) | Sets a double value that specifies the degree of blur effect applied to the reflection effect in points. The default value is 0.0. |
| [set_Distance](./set_distance/)(double) | Sets a double value that specifies the amount of separation of the reflected image from the object in points. The default value is 0.0. |
| [set_Size](./set_size/)(double) | Sets a double value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the size of the reflection as a percentage of the reflected object. The default value is 0.0. |
| [set_Transparency](./set_transparency/)(double) | Sets a double value between 0.0 (opaque) and 1.0 (clear) representing the degree of transparency for the reflection effect. The default value is 0.0. |
| static [Type](./type/)() |  |
## Remarks


Use the [Reflection](../shapebase/get_reflection/) property to access reflection properties of an object. You do not create instances of the [ReflectionFormat](./) class directly.
