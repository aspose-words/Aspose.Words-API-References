## ChartDataLabelCollection::get_Rotation method


Gets or sets the rotation of the data labels of the entire series in degrees.

```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Words::Drawing::Charts::ChartDataLabelCollection::get_Rotation()
```

## Remarks


The range of acceptable values is from -180 to 180 inclusive. The default value is 0.

If the [Orientation](../get_orientation/) value is [Horizontal](../../../aspose.words.drawing/shapetextorientation/), label shapes, if they exist, are rotated along with the label text. Otherwise, only the label text is rotated.
