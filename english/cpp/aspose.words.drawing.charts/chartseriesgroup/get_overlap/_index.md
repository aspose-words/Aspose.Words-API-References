## ChartSeriesGroup::get_Overlap method


Gets or sets the percentage of how much the series bars or columns overlap.

```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Words::Drawing::Charts::ChartSeriesGroup::get_Overlap()
```

## Remarks


Applies to series groups of all bar and column types.

The range of acceptable values is from -100 to 100 inclusive. A value of 0 indicates that there is no space between bars/columns. If the value is -100, the distance between bars/columns is equal to their width. A value of 100 means that the bars/columns overlap completely.
