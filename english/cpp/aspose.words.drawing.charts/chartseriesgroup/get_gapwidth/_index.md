## ChartSeriesGroup::get_GapWidth method


Gets or sets the percentage of gap width between chart elements.

```cpp
int32_t Aspose::Words::Drawing::Charts::ChartSeriesGroup::get_GapWidth()
```

## Remarks


Applies only to series groups of the bar, column, pie-of-bar, pie-of-pie, histogram, box&whisker, waterfall and funnel types.

The range of acceptable values is from 0 to 500 inclusive. For bar/column-based series groups, the property represents the space between bar clusters as a percentage of their width. For pie-of-pie and bar-of-pie charts, this is the space between the primary and secondary sections of the chart.
