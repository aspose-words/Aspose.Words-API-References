## Font::ClearFormatting method


Resets to default font formatting.

```cpp
void Aspose::Words::Font::ClearFormatting()
```

## Remarks


Removes all font formatting specified explicitly on the object from which [Font](../) was obtained so the font formatting will be inherited from the appropriate parent.
