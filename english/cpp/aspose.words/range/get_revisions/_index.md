## Range::get_Revisions method


Gets a collection of revisions (tracked changes) that exist in this range.

```cpp
System::SharedPtr<Aspose::Words::RevisionCollection> Aspose::Words::Range::get_Revisions()
```

## Remarks


The returned collection is a "live" collection, which means if you remove parts of a document that contain revisions, the deleted revisions will automatically disappear from this collection.
