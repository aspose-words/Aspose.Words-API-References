**Inheritance:**
java.lang.Object, [com.aspose.words.Field](../../com.aspose.words/field)
```
public class FieldMergeRec extends Field
```

Implements the MERGEREC field.

To learn more, visit the **Working with Fields** documentation article.

At the moment the MERGEREC and MERGESEQ fields implement the same functionality because we don't know for sure how to skip records in Aspose.Words mail merge.
